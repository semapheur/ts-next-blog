## Spacetime
The principle of invariant light speed, which toghether with the principle of relativity form the postulates of special relativity, predicates that the scalar time $t$ and vector spatial coordinates $\mathbf{x} := \left(x_1, x_2, x_3\right)$ form an invariant interval $(ct)^2 - \mathbf{x}^2$ under coordinate transformations. This motivates the concept of spacetime in which physical quantities are described by 4-vectors $x = (ct, \mathbf{x}) = (ct, x_1, x_2, x_3)\in\R^{1,3}$ combining the scaled time $ct$ with the spatial component $\mathbf{x}$. For compatibility with the principle of invariant light speed, the squared norm of a 4-vector $x\in\R^{1,3}$ is defined to equal the invariant interval, i.e. $|x|^2 = (ct)^2 - \mathbf{x}^2$. This invariant interval can be generalized into a bilinear form, $\eta: \R^{1,3}\to\R^{1,3}\to\mathbf{R}$ with $\eta = \mathrm{diag}(1, -1, -1, -1)$, called the Minkowski metric (inner product). For two 4-vectors $u = (u_0, u_1, u_2, u_3), v = (v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3) \in\R^{1,3}$ this metric has the form

$$
  u\cdot v := \eta(u, v) = u_0 v_0 - u_1 v_1 - u_2 v_2 - u_3 v_3 
$$

The Minkowski metric has the following properties for all $u, v, w \in\R^{1,3}$ and $a\in\R$
- Linearity in first argument: $\eta(au + v, w) = a\eta(u, w) + \eta(v, w)$
- Symmetry: $n(u, w) = n(v, u)$
- Non-degeneracy: $\eta(u, v) = 0\; \forall v \neq 0 \implies u = 0$

The Minkowski metric is not a proper inner product as it is not positive definitive.

The space of 4-vectors equipped with the Minkowski metric is called a Minkowski space $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$. Due to the mixed signs of the Minkowski metric, the norm of 4-vectors need not be positive as in standard Euclidean space. Writing the squared norm of 4-vector as $a\cdot a = \epsilon_a |a|^2$ where $\epsilon_a = \pm 1$ is a signature, three qualitatively different classes of vectors are identified
- timelike: $|a| > 0 \iff \epsilon_a = 1$
- spacelike: $|a| < 0 \iff \epsilon_a = -1$
- lightlike: $|a|^2 = 0$

## Spacetime product

The Minkowski space lacks a notion of the cross product, and is thus incomplete as a model of relativistic physics. The introduction of a product on a vector space creates an algebra. A geometry can be imposed on spacetime by defining the geometric product by the following rules for any $u, v, w \in\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$
- associativity: $(uv)w = u(vw)$
- distributivity: 
  - $u(v + w) = uv + uw$
  - $(v + w)u = vu + wu$
- contraction: $v^2 = \eta(v, v) \epsilon_v |v|^2$

The contraction property distinguishes the resulting spacetime algebra as an orthogonal Clifford algebra $\mathrm{Cl}_{1,3}(\R)$ that is generated by the metric $\eta$ and the vector space $\mathcal{M}_{1, 3}$. This Clifford algebra is the largest associative algebra that can be constructed solely from the spacetime.

Decomposing the resulting associative geometric product into symmetric and antisymmetric parts, produces the proper spacetime generalizations to the dot and cross products of $\R^3$

$$
  uv = u\cdot v + u \wedge v \quad
$$

The symmetric part of the product

$$
  u\cdot v := \frac{1}{2}(uv + vu) = v\cdot u = \eta(u, v) 
$$

is precisely the Minkowski metric inherited from the spacetime structure of $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$. 

The antisymmetric part of the product

$$
  u\wedge v := \frac{1}{2}(uv - vu) = -v\wedge u 
$$

is called the outer (wedge) product and is the generalization of the vector cross product for 4-vectors. It produces a qualitatively new type of object called bivectors. Geometrically, the bivector produced from spacelike vectors $u$ and $v$ is a plane segment with magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by $u$ and $v$, and a surface orientation determined by the right hand rule. 

For any pair of orthogonal vectors $v$ and $w$ with $v\cdot w = 0$, the square of their outer product is

$$
  (v\wedge w)^2 = (vw)(vw) = -vwwv = -v^2w^2
$$

From the spacetime product an inverse of a vector $v$ may be defined as $v^{-1} := \frac{v}{|v|^2}$ such that

$$
  v^{-1}v = \frac{v}{|v|^2}v = \frac{|v|^2}{|v|^2} = 1 \quad |v|^2 \neq 0
$$

### Projection and rejection

Consider two vectors $u$ and $v$. The vector $u$ can be decomposed as $u = u_\parallel + u_\perp$ where $u_\parallel$ is a projection of $u$ onto $v$, while $u_\perp$ is a rejection of $u$ from $v$. Manipulating the product $uv$ we can derive expressions for $u_\parallel$ and $\perp$

$$
\begin{align*}
  uv &= \left(u_\parallel + u_\perp\right)v = u_\parallel v + u_\perp v \\
  &=  u_\parallel v - v u_\perp = u_\parallel v - v\left(u - u_\parallel\right) = u_\parallel v - vu - u_\parallel \\
  2u_\parallel &= uv + vu \\
  u_\parallel v &= \frac{1}{2}(uv + vu) = u\cdot v \\
  u_\parallel &= (u\cdot v)v^{-1} = (u\cdot v)\frac{v}{v^2} = \frac{u\cdot v}{v\cdot v} v
\end{align*}
$$

The rejection $u_\perp$ becomes

$$
\begin{align*}
  u_\perp &= u - u_\parallel \\
  &= u - (u\cdot v)v^{-1} = (uv - u\cdot v)v^{-1} \\
  &= (u\wedge v)v^{-1}
\end{align*}
$$

If $|v| = 1 \iff v^{-1} = v$, then the projection and rejection reduce to

$$
\begin{align*}
  u_\parallel = (u\cdot v)v \\
  u_\perp = (u\wedge v)v
\end{align*}
$$

### Reflection

The reflection of $u$ in the plane perpendicular to $v$ is the vector $u' = u_\parallel - u_\perp$ given by 

$$
\begin{align*}
  u' &= u_\parallel - u_\perp \\
  vu' &= v\left( u_\parallel - u_\perp \right) = vu_\parallel - vu_\perp \\
  &= u_\parallel v + u_\perp v = (u_\parallel + u_\perp)v = uv \\
  u' &= v^{-1}uv
\end{align*}
$$

### Rotor

Combining two reflections of a vector $v$ in a plane specified by two unit vector $n$ and $m$ produces a rotation

$$
  v \mapsto -m(-nvn)m = mnv(mn)^\sim = Rv\tilde{R}
$$

where $R := mn$ defines a rotor satisfying $R\tilde{R} = \tilde{R} = 1$. 

## Multivectors

| Grade | Orthonormal basis | Blade type | Geometry |
| :-: | :-: | --- | --- |
| 4 | $\color{red}{\gamma_{0123}} = I$ | pseudoscalars | 4-volumes |
| 3 | $$\begin{aligned}\color{red}{\gamma_{123}} &= \gamma_0 I \\ \color{blue}{\gamma_{230}} &= \gamma_1 I \\ \color{blue}{\gamma_{310}} &= \gamma_2 I \\ \color{blue}{\gamma_{120}} &= \gamma_3 I\end{aligned}$$ | pseudovectors | 3-volumes |
| 2 | $\color{red}{\gamma_{10}}\;\color{red}{\gamma_{20}}\;\color{red}{\gamma_{30}}\;\color{blue}{\gamma_{23}}\;\color{blue}{\gamma_{31}}\;\color{blue}{\gamma_{12}}$ | bivectors | planes |
| 1 | $\color{blue}{\gamma_{0}}\;\color{red}{\gamma_{1}}\;\color{red}{\gamma_{2}}\;\color{red}{\gamma_{3}}$ | vectors | lines |
| 0 | $\color{blue}{1}$ | scalars | points |

By iteratively appending all objects generated by the wedge product to $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$, a spacetime algebra $\mathcal{G}_4 = \mathrm{G}(\mathcal{M}_{1,3})$ is formed that is equivalent to a Clifford algebra $\mathrm{Cl}_{1,3}(\R)$. The elements of $G_4$ are called multivectors. The repeated outer products produce 5 linearly independent subspaces of the total algebra, known as grades.
- grade 0: scalars $\alpha\in\R$
- grade 1: 4-vectors (line segments) $v\in\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$
- grade 2: bivectors (plane segments) $u\wedge v$
- grade 3: trivectors/pseudovectors (3-volume) $u\wedge v\wedge w$
- grade 4: quadvectors/pseudoscalars (4-volume) $u\wedge v\wedge w\wedge x$

The elements of a $k$-grade subspace are referred to as $k$-blades to distinguish them from the 4-vectors. In general, the outer product of multivectors is called an inflation as it raises the grade. The outer product of a vector $v$ with a $k$-blade $K$ produces a $(k+1)$-blade as

$$
  v \wedge K := \langle v K \rangle_{k+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left[ vK + (-1)^k Kv \right] = (-1)^k K \wedge v
$$

The inner product of multivectors lowers the grade and is thus called a contraction. The corresponding inner product of a vector $v$ with a $k$-blade is a $(k - 1)$-blade as

$$
  v\cdot K := \langle v K \rangle_{k-1}  = \frac{1}{2}\left[ vK + (-1)^{k+1} Kv \right] = (-1)^{k+1}K\cdot v
$$

Combining the outer and inner products we obtain

$$
  vK = v\cdot K + v\wedge K
$$

### Basis
A complete graded basis for $G_4$ can be generated from the spacetime product of an orthonormal basis $\Set{ \gamma_\mu }_{\mu=0}^3 \subset \mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ with the multiplication rule

$$
  \gamma_\mu\gamma_\nu + \gamma_\nu\gamma_\mu = 2\eta_{\mu\nu}
$$

The orhonormality implies that $\gamma_\mu\cdot\gamma_\nu = \eta_{\mu\nu}$ so $\gamma_0^2 = 1$ and $\gamma_i^2 = -1$ for $i = 1, 2, 3$.
- the basis of 0-blades is the real number $1$
- the basis of 1-blades is the chosen set of orthonormal basisvectors $\gamma_\mu$
- the basis of 2-blades is formed from the products $\gamma_mu\gamma_\nu = \gamma_mu\wedge\gamma_\nu =: \gamma_{\mu\nu} = -\gamma_{\nu\mu},\; \mu\neq\nu$, which produces only $(16-4)/2 = 6$ independent basisvectors (see table).
- the basis of 3-blades is formed from the products $\gamma_\mu\gamma_nu\gamma_\delta = \gamma_mu\wedge\gamma_\nu\wedge\gamma_\delta =: \gamma_{\mu\nu\delta}$, which produces only 4 independent trivectors (see table).
- the basis of 4-blades is the quadvector $\gamma_0\gamma_1\gamma_2\gamma_3 = \gamma_0\wedge\gamma_1\wedge\gamma_2\wedge\gamma_3 =: \gamma_{0123}$

The bivector basis generate two types of rotations in spacetime dependent on the signature. The spacelike Euclidean bivectors satisfy $\left(\gamma_i \wedge \gamma_j\right)^2 = \gamma_{ij}^2 = -\gamma_i^2\gamma_j^2 = -1$ for $i,j = 1,2,3$ and generate spatial rotations since by Euler's formula (noting $\gamma_{ij}^{2k} = (-1)^k$ and $\gamma_{ij}\gamma_{ij}^{2k} = (-1)^k\gamma_{ij}$ for $k\in\N$)

$$
\begin{align*}
  e^{\gamma_{ij}\theta} &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(\gamma_{ij}\theta)^k}{k!} \\
  &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{\theta^{2k}}{2k!} + (-1)^k \gamma_{ij} \frac{\theta^{2k + 1}}{(2k + 1)!} \\
  &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{\theta^{2k}}{2k!} + \gamma_{ij} \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{\theta^{2k + 1}}{(2k + 1)!} \\
  &= \cos(\theta) + \gamma_{ij}\sin(\theta)
\end{align*}
$$

The timelike bivectors satisfy $\left(\gamma_i \wedge \gamma_j\right) = -\gamma_i^2\gamma_0^2 = 1$ and generate hyperbolic rotations since (noting $\gamma_{i0}^{2k + 1} = \gamma_{i0}$ for $k\in\N$)

$$
\begin{align*}
  e^{\gamma_{i0}\theta} &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(\gamma_{i0}\theta)^k}{k!} \\
  &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\theta^{2k}}{2k!} + \gamma_{i0} \frac{\theta^{2k + 1}}{(2k + 1)!} \\
  &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\theta^{2k}}{2k!} + \gamma_{i0} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\theta^{2k + 1}}{(2k + 1)!} \\
  &= \cosh(\theta) + \gamma_{i0}\sinh(\theta)
\end{align*}
$$

The 4-blade basis $\gamma_{0123}$ geometrically signifies the same unit 4-volume in any basis and is given a special notation $I := \gamma_{0123}$ motivated by the fact that $I^2 = \gamma_0^2\gamma_1^2\gamma_2^2\gamma_3^2 = (1)(-1)(-1)(-1) = -1$. This element thus acts similarly to the imaginary unit and provides spacetime with an intrinsic complex structure without any ad hoc introduction of the scalar complex numbers.

### Duality

The pseudoscalar $I$ has the follow property for any 4-vector $v$

$$
  Ia = -aI
$$

This property induces a geometric concept of duality. The dual of a $k$-blade $K$ in spacetime algebra is the $(4 - k)$-blade defined (up to a sign) by $IK$ or $KI$. It can be shown that the inner and products are dual to one another by expanding the associative identity $(vK)I = v(KI)$ in two ways

$$
  (v\cdot K + v\wedge K)I = v\cdot (KI) + v \wedge (KI)
$$

Each side of this identity has parts of grade $(4 - k \pm 1)$ and which can be separately equated, because they are linearly independent. This gives the duality identities

$$
\begin{align*}
  v\cdot (K)I &= v\wedge (KI) \\
  v\wedge (K)I &= v\cdot (KI)
\end{align*}
$$

The latter identity can be solved for

$$
  v\cdot K = \left[v\wedge (KI) \right]I^{-1}
$$

### Expanded form
Any multivector $M \in G_4$ can be written in the expanded form as a sum of independent $k$-blades

$$
\begin{align*}
  M &= \alpha + v + \mathbf{F} + \mathfrak{F} + \beta I \\
  M &= \sum_{k=0}^4 \langle M \rangle_k
\end{align*}
$$

where
- Greek letters $\alpha, \beta$ are real numbers
- the lowercase Roman letter $v$ is a 4-vector
- the boldface Roman letter $\mathbf{F}$ is a bivector
- the Fraktur letter $\mathfrak{F}$ is a trivector

Any trivector $\mathfrak{F}$ can be written as a product of a vector and the pseudoscalar $I$
 
$$
  \mathfrak{F} = f_0\gamma_{123} + f_1\gamma_{230} + f_2\gamma_{310} + f_3\gamma_{120} = \left(\sum_{\mu=0}^3 f_\mu \gamma_\mu\right) I = fI
$$ 

where $f$ is a vector. The expanded form of a multivector can thus be reformulated as

$$
  M = \alpha + v + \mathbf{F} + wI + \beta I \\
$$

With this expansion, any multivector $M \in G_4$ can be decomposed into a part $M_+ = \alpha + F + \beta I$ of even grades and a part $M_- = v + wI$ of odd grades, or equivalently by

$$
  M_\pm = \frac{1}{2}(M \mp IMI).
$$

The set of all even multivectors forms the even subalgebra of $G_4$.

Each $k$-blade in a multivector can be extracted by a suitable grade-projection, denoted $\langle M \rangle_k$. Notably, the scalar projection satisfies the syclic property

$$
  \langle MN \rangle_0 = \langle NM \rangle_0 \quad \forall M,N \in G_4
$$

and represents an algebraic trace operation.

### Bivectors

A product between a vector $a$ and a bivector $\mathbf{F}$ can be split into a vector and a trivector component

$$
  a\mathbf{F} = a\cdot\mathbf{F} + a\wedge\mathbf{F}
$$

where the vector and trivector parts are constructed respectively as

$$
\begin{align*}
  a\cdot\mathbf{F} &:= \langle a\mathbf{F}\rangle_1 = \frac{1}{2}(a\mathbf{F} - \mathbf{F}a) = -\mathbf{F}\cdot a \\
  a\wedge\mathbf{F} &:= \langle a\mathbf{F}\langle_3 = \frac{1}{2}(a\mathbf{F} - \mathbf{F}a) = \mathbf{F}\wedge a
\end{align*}
$$

The geometric meaning of these products can be ascertained for spacelike $\mathbf{F}$ be decomposing $a$ into parts perpendicular ($a_\perp$) and parallel ($a_\parallel$) to the plane of $\mathbf{F}$. By factoring $\mathbf{F}$ into constituent orthogonal vectors, $\mathbf{F} = b\wedge c = bc$ with $b\cdot c = 0$, we find

$$
\begin{align*}
  a\mathbf{F} &= abc = \frac{1}{2}a_\parallel(bc - cb) + a_\perp\wedge b \wedge c \\
  \mathbf{F} &= bca = \frac{1}{2}(bc - cb)a_\parallel + a_\perp\wedge b\wedge c
\end{align*}
$$

the inner and outer products thus take the forms

$$
\begin{align*}
  a\cdot\mathbf{F} &= a_\parallel\cdot\mathbf{F} = \left(a_\parallel - b \right)c - (a_\parallel \cdot c)b \\
  a\wedge\mathbf{F} &= a_\perp\wedge\mathbf{F} = a_\perp \wedge b \wedge c
\end{align*}
$$

The contraction $a\cdot\mathbf{F}$ produces a vector in the plane of $\mathbf{F}$ that is perpendicular to $a_\parallel$. The inflation $a\wedge\mathbf{F}$ produces a trivector with magnitude equal to the volume of the parallelipiped constructed from dragging the plane segment $\mathbf{F}$ along $a_\perp$.

### Commutator product

The commutator product of two multivectors $A$ and $B$ is defined as

$$
  A\times B := \frac{1}{2}(AB - BA) = -B\times A
$$

with the properties
- distributivity: $A\times(BC) = (A\times B)C + B(A\times C)$
- Jacobi identity: $A\times (B\times C) = (A\times B)\times C + B\times (A\times C)$

The relation of the commutator product to the inne and outer products is grade dependent. For a vector $v$ this relation becomes

$$
\begin{align*}
  v\times \langle M\rangle_k &= v\wedge\langle M\rangle_k \quad \textrm{for odd }k \\
  v\times \langle M\rangle_k &= v\cdot\langle M\rangle_k \quad \textrm{for even }k 
\end{align*}
$$

With any bivector $A$ this product is grade preserving

$$
  A\times\langle M\rangle_k = \langle A\times M\rangle_k
$$

This implies that the space of bivectors is closed under the commutator product. It therefore forms a Lie algebra, which is the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. Using the commutator product, the spacetime product of a bivector $A$ with a multivector $M$ of grade $\geq 2$ can be expanded into

$$
  AM = A\cdot M + A\times M + A\wedge M
$$

## Reversion and inversion

The reversion of a multivector $M = \alpha + v - \mathbf{F} - \mathfrak{F} + \beta I$ is defined as

$$
  \tilde{M} = \alpha + v -\mathbf{F} -\mathfrak{F} + \beta I
$$

The reversion of a vector product reverses the order of the product

$$
  (ab)^\sim := ba
$$

The reversion distributes across general multivector products recursively $(AB)^\sim = \tilde{B}\tilde{A}$, and is the algebraic equivalent of the transpose operation for matrices. The reverse inverts itself $\left(\tilde{M}\right)^\sim = m$

The reverse of bivector is its negation $\tilde{\mathbf{F}} = -\mathbf{F}$, which follows from the fact that the reversion flips the outer product of the bivector basis

$$
  \tilde{\gamma_{\mu\nu}} = \gamma_\nu\gamma_\mu = \gamma_\nu\wedge\gamma_mu = -\gamma_\mu\wedge\gamma_\nu = -\gamma_{\mu\nu}
$$

The pseudoscalar reverses to itself $\tilde{I} = \gamma_{3210} = \gamma_{0123} = I$.

The product of a pure $k$-blade $M = \langle M \rangle_k$ with its reverse $\tilde{M}$ produces a scalar. The reversed-square of a pure $k$-blade is

$$
  \tilde{M}M = M\tilde{M} = \epsilon_M |M|^2
$$

It follows that if $|M|^2 \neq 0$, then

$$
  M^1 := \frac{\tilde{M}}{\tilde{M}M}
$$

is the inverse of a pure $k$-blade that satisfies $M^{-1}M = MM^{-1} = 1$.

## Reciprocal frame

Given a basis $\Set{ \gamma_\mu }_{\mu=0}^3$ for $G_4$, it is convenient to introduce a reciprocal basis $\Set{\gamma^\mu = \left(\gamma_mu\right)^{-1}}_{\mu=0}^3$ satisfying

$$
\begin{split}
  \gamma_mu \cdot \gamma^\nu = \delta_\mu^\nu
\end{split}\textrm{ or }
\begin{split}
    \gamma_mu = \eta_{\mu\nu}\gamma^\nu
\end{split}
$$

From the definition of the algebraic inverse $\gamma^\mu = \frac{\gamma_\mu}{\gamma_mu^2}$, it follows that $\gamma^0 = \gamma_0$ while $\gamma^j = \gamma_j$ for $j=1, 2, 3$, so the reciprocal basis is the spatial inversion of the original basis $\Set{ \gamma_\mu }_{\mu=0}^3$. The dual bases introduces a tensor-like structure, where the original basis vectors $\gamma_\mu$ are covariant, denoted by lowered indices, while the reciprocal basis vectors $\gamma^\mu$ are contravariant, denoted by raised indices. The dual basis can be used to expand a $k$-blade into components of a rank-$k$ antisymmetric tensor. A 4-vector $v$ can be expanded as

$$
  v = v^\mu \gamma_mu = v_\mu \gamma^\mu
$$

where the components in the original basis $v^\gamma = \gamma^\mu \cdot v$ are contravariant, while the components in the reciprocal basis $v_\gamma = \gamma_\mu \cdot v$ are covariant.

A bivector $\mathbf{F}$ can be expanded in both bases as

$$
  \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{2} F^{\mu\nu} \gamma_\mu\wedge\gamma_nu = \frac{1}{2}F_{\mu\nu}\gamma^\mu\wedge\gamma^\nu
$$

The components $F^{\mu\nu}$ are called the rank $(2,0)$ (contravariant) components of $\mathbf{F}$ and are given by

$$
  F^{\mu\nu} = \gamma^\mu\cdot\mathbf{F}\cdot\gamma^\nu = \gamma^\nu\cdot\left(\gamma^\mu\cdot\mathbf{F}\right) = \left(\gamma^\nu\wedge\gamma^\mu\right)\cdot\mathbf{F} = \gamma^{\nu\mu}\cdot\mathbf{F} = \left(\gamma_{\mu\nu}\right)^{-1}\cdot\mathbf{F}
$$

The components $F_{\mu\nu} = \gamma_mu\cdot\mathbf{F}\cdot\gamma_\nu$ are called the rank $(0, 2)$ (covariant) components of $\mathbf{F}$. Similarly, the components $F_{\;\nu}^\mu = \gamma^\mu\cdot\mathbf{F}\cdot\gamma_nu$ and $F_\mu^{\;\nu} = \gamma_mu\cdot\mathbf{F}\cdot\gamma^\nu$ are rank $(1, 1)$ components for $\mathbf{F}$. The various ranked tensor components corresponding to $\mathbf{F}$ all refer to the action of the same antisymmetric tensor $\underline{F}: \mathcal{M}_{1,3}\times\mathcal{M}_{1,3}\to\R$, which is a multilinear function

$$
\begin{align*}
  \underline{F}(a, b) &:= a\cdot\mathbf{F}\cdot b = b\cdot(a\cdot F) = (b\wedge a)\cdot\mathbf{F} \\
  &= a^\gamma F_{\mu\nu} b^\nu = a_\mu F^{\mu\nu} b_\nu = a_\mu F_\nu^\mu = a^\mu F_\mu^\nu b_\nu
\end{align*}
$$

that produces a scalar through a total contraction with $\mathbf{F}$.

## Complex structure

| Complex blade type | Basis elements | Dual elements |
| --- | --: | --- |
| bivector $\mathbf{F}$ | $\color{red}{\gamma_{10}}$ $\color{red}{\gamma_{20}}$ $\color{red}{\gamma_{30}}$ | $\color{blue}{\gamma_{10}I} = \color{blue}{-\gamma_{23}}$ $\color{blue}{\gamma_{20}I} = \color{blue}{-\gamma_{31}}$ $\color{blue}{\gamma_{30}I} = \color{blue}{-\gamma_{12}}$ |
| complex vector $z$ | $\color{blue}{\gamma_0}$ $\color{red}{\gamma_1}$ $\color{red}{\gamma_2}$ $\color{red}{\gamma_3}$ | $\color{red}{\gamma_0 I} = \color{red}{\gamma_{123}}$ $\color{blue}{\gamma_1 I} = \color{blue}{\gamma_{230}}$ $\color{blue}{\gamma_2 I} = \color{blue}{\gamma_{310}}$ $\color{blue}{\gamma_1 I} = \color{blue}{\gamma_{120}}$ |
| complex scale $\zeta$ | $\color{blue}{1}$ | $\color{red}{I}$ |

Since the pseudoscalar $I := \gamma_{0123}$ satisfies $I^2 = -1$, the subalgebra of the form $\zeta = \alpha + \beta I$ for $\alpha, \beta \in \R$ is equivalent to the complex scalar numbers. The pseudoscalar has several other properties
- $I$ commutes with elements of even grade, i.e. scalars, bivectors, pseudoscalars, and anticommutes with elements of odd grade, i.e. vectors and trivectors
- a right product with $I$ is a duality transformation from grade $k$ to its orthogonal complement of grade $(4 - k)$

The duality transformation induced by $I$ is equivalent to the Hodege-star transformation in differential forms, and splits the spacetime algebra into two halves that are geometric complements to each other. Any multivector $M\in G_4$ can be written in an intrinsically complex form that pairs quantities with their documentclass

$$
\begin{gather*}
  M = \zeta + z + \mathbf{F}\\
  \zeta := \alpha + \beta I \quad \alpha, \beta\in\R \\
  z := v + wI = v - Iw \quad v, w\in\mathcal{M}_{1,3}
\end{gather*}
$$

Since $I$ anticommutes with vectors, complex scalars and vectors only quasi commute

$$
  \zeta z = (\alpha + \beta I)z = z(\alpha - \beta I) = z\zeta^* \neq z\zeta
$$

while complex scalars and bivectors commute, $\zeta\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F}\zeta$. Thus, the pseudoscalar $I$ is only algebraically equivalent to the imaginary unit $i = \sqrt{-1}$ when restricted to the even graded subalgebra of complex scalars and bivectors.

### Canonical form of even multivectors

If $M$ is an even multivector, then $M\tilde{M}$ is also even and can be expanded as $M\tilde{M} = \alpha + F + \beta I$. Since $\left(M\tilde{M}\right)^\sim = M\tilde{M}$, the bivector part vanishes as it changes sign under reversion. Therefore, we can write

$$
  M\tilde{M} = \alpha + \beta I = \rho e^{I\varphi}
$$

If $\rho \neq 0$, we can derive an even multivector $R = M\left(M\tilde{M}\right)^{-1/2}$ satisfying

$$
  R\tilde{R} = \tilde{R}R = 1
$$

Then $M$ can be put in the canonical form

$$
  M = \left(\rho e^{I\varphi} \right)^{1/2}R
$$

### Canonical form of bivectors

The bivector basis is self-dual

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \gamma_{10}I &= -\gamma_{23} \\
  \gamma_{23}I &= \gamma_{10}
\end{aligned}\quad
\begin{aligned}
  \gamma_{20}I &= -\gamma_{31} \\
  \gamma_{31}I &= \gamma_{20}
\end{aligned}\quad
\begin{aligned}
  \gamma_{30}I &= -\gamma_{12} \\
  \gamma_{12}I &= \gamma_{30}
\end{aligned}
$$

Geometrically, these duality relations express the fact that in $4$ dimensions the orthogonal complement to any plane is another plane (not a normal vector as in 3 dimensions). The duality relations can be expressed more compactly in terms of the completely antisymmetric Levi-Civita symbol

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \gamma_{i0}I = -\epsilon_{ijk}\gamma_{jk}
\end{aligned}\quad
\begin{aligned}
  \gamma_{jk}I = \epsilon_{ijk}\gamma_{i0}
\end{aligned}
$$

The self-duality of the bivector basis makes the signature of a general bivector mixed, even though each basis bivector has a well-defined signature $\gamma_{i0}\tilde{\gamma}_{i0} = (1)(-1) = -1$ or $\gamma_{jk}\tilde{\gamma}_{jk} = (-1)(-1) = 1$. Consider for example the mixed bivector $\mathbf{F} = \gamma_{10} + \gamma_{23}$. Its reversed square is

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{F}}\mathbf{F} &= \left[\gamma_{01} + \gamma_{23}\right]\left[ \gamma_{10} + \gamma_{23} \right] \\
  &= \gamma_{01}\gamma_{10} + \gamma_{01}\gamma_{23} + \gamma_{32}\gamma_{10} + \gamma_{32}\gamma_{23} \\
  &= \gamma_1^2 \gamma_0^2 + \gamma_{0123} + \gamma_{3210} + \gamma_2^2\gamma_3^2 \\
  &= (-1)(1) + I + I + (-1)(-1) \\
  &= 2I
\end{align*}
$$

The cross-term between the basis elements of different signature produces a complex signature $\epsilon_\mathbf{F} = I$. The reversed square of any bivector $\mathbf{F}$ will produce $\mathbf{F}\tilde{\mathbf{F}} = \epsilon_\mathbf{F} |\mathbf{F}|^2$ where $\epsilon_\mathbf{F} = \alpha + \beta I$ is a complex signature with unit magnitude $\alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 1$. As such, this signature can be written using a phase angle $\epsilon_\mathbf{F} = e^{2\theta I} = \cos(2\theta) + I\sin(2\theta)$. It follows that a bivector $\mathbf{F}$ must have a canonical (frame-independent) form with an intrinsic phase

$$
  \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{f}e^{\theta I} = \mathbf{f}(\cos\theta + I\sin\theta)
$$

where $\mathbf{f}$ is the canonical bivector for $\mathbf{F}$ defined as $\mathbf{f}\tilde{\mathbf{f}} = -|\mathbf{F}|^2$. The phase an and canonical bivector can be directly extracted from $\mathbf{F}$ according to

$$
\begin{split}
  \theta = \frac{1}{2}\arctan \frac{\ell_2}{\ell_1}
\end{split}\quad
\begin{split}
  \mathbf{f} = \mathbf{F}e^{-\theta I}
\end{split}
$$

where $\ell_1 = \left\langle \mathbf{F}^2 \right\rangle_0 = |\mathbf{F}|^2 \cos 2\theta$ and $\ell_2 = \left\langle\mathbf{F}^2\right\langle_4 I^{-1} = |\mathbf{F}|^2 \sin 2\theta$ are the scalar parts of its square $\mathbf{F}^2 = \ell_1 + \ell_2 I$. The inverse of a bivector $\mathbf{F}$ has the canonical form

$$
  \mathbf{F}^{-1} = \frac{\mathbf{f}}{|\mathbf{F}|^2}e^{-\varphi I}
$$

Whenever $\mathbf{f}^2 = 1$, the bivector canonical form represents a parametrized rotation such that any rotor $R$ can be expressed in the exponential form in terms of a bivector $\mathbf{F} = (\alpha + I\beta)\mathbf{f}$

$$
  \pm R = e^{\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{F}} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!}\left(\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{F}\right)^k
$$

The rotor $R$ always takes positive sign when $\mathbf{F}^2 \neq 0$

### Bivector products

The product of two bivectors $\mathbf{F}$ and $\mathbf{G}$ can be split into three distinct grades (scalar, bivector and pseudoscalar)

$$
  \mathbf{FG} = \langle\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{G}\rangle_0 + \underbrace{[\mathbf{F},\mathbf{G}]}_{:= \langle\mathbf{F}\mathbf{G}\rangle_2} + \langle\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{G}\rangle_4
$$

By making the canonical decompositions $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{f}e^{\vartheta I}$ and $\mathbf{G} = \mathbf{g}e^{\phi I}$, the complex scalar $\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{G}$ can be written as

$$
  \mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{G} = (\mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{g})e^{(\vartheta + \varphi)I} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{f}\mathbf{g} + \mathbf{g}\mathbf{f})e^{(\vartheta + \varphi)I}
$$

The scalar and pseudoscalar components of the bivector product take the form

$$
\begin{align*}
  \langle\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{G}\rangle_0 &= (\mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{g})\cos(\vartheta + \varphi) \\
  \langle\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{G}\rangle_4 &= (\mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{g})\sin(\vartheta + \varphi)I
\end{align*}
$$

The antisymmetric component of the bivector product is written as a commutator bracket that produces another bivector

$$
  [\mathbf{F},\mathbf{G}] := \langle\mathbf{F}\mathbf{G}\rangle_2 = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{F}\mathbf{G} - \mathbf{G}\mathbf{F})
$$

For completeness, the bivector cross product is defined as the dual of the commutator bracket

$$
  \mathbf{F}\times\mathbf{G} := [\mathbf{F},\mathbf{G}]I^{-1}
$$

with the following properties
- Distributivity: $F\times (GH) = (F\times G)H + G(F\times H)$
- Jacobi identity: $F\times(G\times H) = (F\times G)\times H + G\times(F\times H)$

The spacetime product of a bivector $A$ with a multivector $M$ of grade $\geq 2$ has the expanded form

$$
  AM = A\cdot M + A\times M + A\wedge M
$$

### Complex conjugation

The complex conjugate of a multivector $M\in G_4$ is defined by fliping the sign of the pseudoscalar

$$
  M^* := M|_{I\to -I} = (\alpha - \beta I) + (v - wI) + \mathbf{f}e^{-\varphi I}
$$

Geometrically, the flip in pseudoscalar sign corresponds to changing the orientation of spacetime. Since $(M^*)^* = M$, conjugation is also an involution on the algebra. Note that complex conjugation distributes over products involving only complex scalars and bivectors. This does not generally apply to products involving vectors because $I$ anticommutes with vectors, e.g. $(zM)^* \neq M*z* \neq z*M*$. Due, to this anticommution the conjugation of a complex vector is equal to its reversion $\tilde{z} = (v + wI)^\sim = v + Iw = v - wI = z^*$, since $I$ anticommutes with vectors. Note that complex conjugation does not generally distribute across products that involve vectors, 

With the complex conjugation, we can write the proper complex generalizations of the blade inverse

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \zeta^{-1} &= \frac{\zeta^*}{\zeta^* \zeta} \\
  &= \frac{\alpha - \beta}{\alpha^2 + \beta^2}
\end{aligned}\quad
\begin{aligned}
  z^{-1} &= \frac{z^*}{z^* z} \\
  &= \frac{v - wI}{v^2 + w^2 + 2(v\cdot w)I}
\end{aligned}\quad
\begin{aligned}
  \mathbf{F}^{-1} &= \frac{\mathbf{F}^*}{\mathbf{F}^* \mathbf{F}} \\
  &= \frac{\mathbf{f}e^{-\varphi I}}{|\mathbf{F}|^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Spacetime split

Spacetime algebra inherently describes physical processes by proper (coordinate free) equations, but provides a way to express those equations in terms of a particular inertial system through a spacetime split. In spacetime algebra, a given inertial system is completely characterized by a single future-pointing, timelike unit vector. In the intertial frame characterized by $\gamma_0$, the spacetime split of a coordinate 4-vector $x = ct + \sum_{i=0}^3 x_i$ is given by a mapping of spacetime into the even subalgebra

$$
\begin{gather*}
  x\gamma_0 = x\cdot\gamma_0 + x\wedge\gamma_0 =: t + \mathbf{x} \\
  \gamma_0 x = \gamma_0 \cdot v + \gamma_0\wedge x =: t - \mathbf{x}
\end{gather*}
$$

which is the sum of a relative scalar time $t$ (with $c = 1$) and a $3$-vector of the relative spatial coordinates $\mathbf{x}$. This combination of a relative scalar and a relative $3$-vector is commonly called a paravector and is often written as a tuple $(t, \mathbf{x})$ instead of a sum. Using the paravector duality, we can recover the invariant interval $t^2 - \mathbf{x}^2$ directly without the need of a Lorentz transformation

$$
  x^2 = (x\gamma_0)(\gamma_0 x) = (t - \mathbf{x})(t + \mathbf{x}) = t^2 - \mathbf{x}^2
$$

The set of all $3$-vectors relative to $\gamma_0$ is denoted $\mathcal{P}^3(\gamma_0) = \Set{ \mathbf{x} = x\wedge\gamma_0 }$. By the geometric product and sum, the vectors in $\mathcal{P}^3$ generate the entire even subalgebra of $G_4$ as the geometric algebra $G_3 = G\left(\mathcal{P}^3\right)$. The standard orthonormal basis $\Set{\boldsymbol{\sigma}_i}_{i=1}^3$ for $\mathcal{P}^3(\gamma_0)$ is given by

$$
\begin{gather*}
  \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i := \gamma_{i0} = \gamma_i\wedge\gamma_0 = \gamma_i\gamma_0 \quad i \in \Set{1, 2, 3}\\
  \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i I = -\epsilon_{ijk}\gamma_{jk}
\end{gather*}
$$

The basis is indeed orthonormal as

$$
\begin{align*}
  \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}_j &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\gamma_{i0}\gamma_{j0} - \gamma_{j0}\gamma_{i0} \right) \\
  &= \frac{1}{2}\left( -\gamma_{ij} - \gamma_{ji} \right) = 0 
\end{align*}
$$

The basis for the relative bivectors is given by

$$
  \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i \wedge \boldsymbol{\sigma}_j = \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i\boldsymbol{\sigma}_j = -\epsilon_{ijk}I\boldsymbol{\sigma}_k = \gamma_{ji}
$$

The righthanded pseudoscalar for $\mathcal{P}^3$ is identical to that for $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$

$$
  \boldsymbol{\sigma}_1\boldsymbol{\sigma}_2\boldsymbol{\sigma}_3 = \gamma_{0123} = I
$$

Applying the bivector cross product $\mathbf{F}\times\mathbf{G} = [\mathbf{F},\mathbf{G}]I^{-1} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{F}\mathbf{G} - \mathbf{G}\mathbf{F}]I^{-1}$ for the relative basis we find

$$
\begin{align*}
  \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i \times \boldsymbol{\sigma}_j &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\gamma_{i0}\gamma_{j0} - \gamma_{j0}\gamma_{i0}\right)I^{-1} \\
  &= \frac{1}{2}\left(-\gamma_{ij} + \gamma_{ji}\right)I^{-1} = \gamma_{ji}I^{-1} \\
  &= \left( \epsilon_{ijk}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_k I \right)I^{-1} \\
  &= \epsilon_{ijk}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_k
\end{align*}
$$

which corresponds to the standard cross product in $\R^3$.

### Bivectors

In terms of the relative $3$-vector basis, a bivector takes the simple form

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{F} &= F_1\gamma_{10} + F_2\gamma_{20} + F_3\gamma_{30} + B_1\gamma_{32} + B_2\gamma_{13} + B_3\gamma_{21} \\ 
  &= \sum_{i=1}^3 E_i\boldsymbol{\sigma}_i + B_i\boldsymbol{\sigma}_i I
  &= \vec{E} + \vec{B}I
\end{align*}
$$

The spacetime split of a bivector can be written as (noting $\gamma_0^{-1} = \gamma_0$)

$$
  \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F}\gamma_0\gamma_0^{-1} = \left( \mathbf{F}\cdot\gamma_0 \right)\gamma_0 + \left(\mathbf{F}\wedge\gamma_0 \right)\gamma_0
$$

The first term contracts $\mathbf{F}$ to a vector perpendicular to $\gamma_0$ and then multiplies by $\gamma_0$ to produce the relative $3$-vector basis. The second term inflates $\mathbf{F}$ to a trivector including $\gamma_0$ and then contracts out the $\gamma_0$ part, leaving the dual basis $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_iI$.

Using the spacetime split for the bivectors, we can rewrite a multivector as

$$
  M = \left[ \left(\alpha + \vec{E}\right) + v \right] + \left[ (\beta + \vec{B}) + w \right]I 
$$

where
- Greek letters, $\alpha, \beta$, are scalars
- the lowercase Roman letters $v, w$ are proper 4-vector
- the uppercase Roman letters with arrows, $\vec{E}, \vec{B}$, are relative $3$-vectors

Using the vector-paravector duality, we can further expand the multivector into a fully frame-dependent form relative to $\gamma_0$

$$
  M = \left[ \left(\alpha + \vec{E} \right) + \left(\delta + \mathbf{p} \right)\gamma_0 \right] + \left[ \left( \beta + \vec{B} \right) + (\omega + \mathbf{a})\gamma_0 \right]I
$$

where
- $\alpha$ is a proper scalar (invariant under both frame transformations and spatial reflections)
- $\beta$ is a proper pseudoscalar (invariant under frame transformations, but flips sign under spatial reflections)
- $\delta$ is a relative scalar part (temporal) of a $4$-vector (invariant under spatial reflections, but changes under frame transformations)
- $\omega$ is a relative pseudoscalar of $wI$ (flips sgn under a spatial reflection and changes under frame transformations)
- $\vec{E}, \mathbf{p}$ are polar relative $3$-vectors (flip sign under spatial reflections)
- $\vec{B}, \mathbf{a}$ are axial relative $3$-vectors (do not flip sign under spatial reflections) 

### Relative reversion

The reversion of $3$-vectors in $P^3$ can be defined by

$$
  \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i^\dagger = \boldsymbol{\sigma} \quad \left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}_i \boldsymbol{\sigma}_j \right)^\dagger = \boldsymbol{\sigma}_j \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i 
$$

To isolate distinct quantities under a particular frame, it is useful to define a relative reversion involution

$$
\begin{align*}
  M^\dagger &= \gamma_0 \tilde{M} \gamma_0 \\
  &= \left[ \left(\alpha + \vec{E} \right) + \left(\delta - \mathbf{p} \right)\gamma_0 \right] + \left[ -\left( \beta + \vec{B} \right) + (\omega - \mathbf{a})\gamma_0 \right]I
\end{align*}
$$

This $\gamma_0$-dependent involution has the effect of the proper complex conjugation for the complex scalars

$$
  \zeta^\dagger = (\alpha + \beta I)^\dagger = \alpha - \beta I = \zeta^*
$$

but has the effect of conjugation with respect to the spacetime split for the complex bivectors

$$
  \mathbf{F}^\dagger = \left(\vec{E} + \vec{B}\right)^\dagger = \vec{E} - \vec{B}I \neq \mathbf{F}^*
$$

In contrast, the relative reversion of a $4$-vector only flips the sign of the relative $3$-vector part

$$
\begin{align*}
  v^\dagger &= \left[\left(\delta + \mathbf{p} \right) \gamma_0 \right]^\dagger = \left(\delta - \mathbf{p}\right)\gamma_0 \\
  (wI)^\dagger &= \left[\left( \omega + \mathbf{a} \right)\gamma_0 I\right]^\dagger = \left(\omega - \mathbf{a}\right)\gamma_0 I
\end{align*}
$$

The relative parts of each geometric object can be extracted with the appropriate relative reversions

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \alpha &= \frac{\zeta + \zeta^\dagger}{2} \\
  \vec{E} &= \frac{\mathbf{F} + \mathbf{F}^\dagger}{2} \\
  \delta &= \frac{v + v^\dagger}{2}\gamma_0^{-1} \\
  \omega &= \frac{wI + (wI)^\dagger}{2}I^{-1}\gamma_0^{-1}
\end{aligned}\quad
\begin{aligned}
  \beta &= \frac{\zeta - \zeta^\dagger}{2} \\
  \vec{B} &= \frac{\mathbf{F} - \mathbf{F}^\dagger}{2} \\
  \mathbf{p} &= \frac{v - v^\dagger}{2}\gamma_0^{-1} \\
  \mathbf{a} &= \frac{wI- (wI)^\dagger}{2}I^{-1}\gamma_0^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Outermorphism

Linear operators on Minkowski space are marked with underbars (or overbars) to distinguish them from vectors. Thus, a linear operator $\underline{f}$ acting on a vector $a$ is written 

$$
  \underline{f}(a) = \underline{f}a
$$

Every linear transformation on Minkowski space has a unique extension to a linear function on the whole spacetime algebra, called an outermorphism as it preserves outer products. The outermorphism is defined by the property for arbitrary multivectors $A$ and $B$

$$
\begin{gather*}
  \underline{f}(A\wedge B) = \left(\underline{f}A\right)\wedge\left(\underline{f}B\right) \\
  \underline{f}\alpha = \alpha
\end{gather*}
$$

Since the outermorphism preserves the outer product, it preserves the grade

$$
  \underline{f}\langle M \rangle_k = \left\langle \underline{f}M \right\rangle_k
$$

for any multivector $M$. This implies that $\underline{f}$ alters the pseudoscalar $I$ only by a scalar multiple, which defines the determinant of $\underline{f}$

$$
  \underline{f}(I) = \left(\det{\underline{f}} \right)I \iff \det{\underline{f}} = -I\underline{f}(I)
$$

The composition (product) of two linear transformations $\underline{h} = \underline{g}\underline{f}$ also extends to a composition of outermorphisms such that

$$
  \det\left(\underline{g}\underline{f} \right) = \left(\det \underline{g} \right)\left(\det \underline{f} \right)
$$

From this, many other properties of the determinant follows, such as

$$
  \det\left( \underline{f}^{-1} \right) = \left( \det \underline{f} \right)^{-1}
$$

whenever $\underline{f}^{-1}$ exists.

### Adjoint outermorphism

Every linear transformation $\underline{f}$ has an adjoint transformation $\overline{f}$ which can be extended to an outermorphism defined by

$$
  \left\langle M \overline{f} N \right\rangle = \left\langle N\underline{f} \right\rangle
$$

where $M$ and $N$ are arbitrary multivectors and the bracket as usual indicates the scalar part. For vectors $a$ and $b$, this can be written

$$
  b\cdot\overline{f}(a) = a\cdot\underline{f}(b)
$$

Differentiating with respect to $b$, we obtain

$$
  \overline{f}(a) = \partial_b a\cdot \underline{f}(b)
$$

which serves as an alternative definition for $\overline{f}$.

Unlike the outer product, the inner product is not generally preserved by outermorphisms. However, it obeys the fundamental transformation law

$$
  \overline{f}\left[ \underline{f}(A)\cdot B \right] = A\cdot \overline{f}(B), \quad \mathrm{grade}(A) \leq \mathrm{grade}(B)
$$

If $\underline{f}$ is invertible, it can be written in the form

$$
  \overline{f}[A\cdot B] = \underline{f}^{-1}(A)\cdot\overline{f}(B)
$$

For $B = I$, since $A\cdot I = AI$, this immediately gives the general formula for the inverse outermorphism

$$
  \underline{f}^{-1}A = \left[\overline{f}(AI)\left(\overline{f}I \right)^{-1} \right] = \left( \det \underline{f} \right)^{-1} \overline{f}(AI)I^{-1}
$$

## Lorentz transformation

Orthogonal transformations on spacetime are called Lorentz transformations. The defining property for a Lorentz transformation $L$ acting on vectors $a$ and $b$ is

$$
  \underline{L}(a) \cdot \underline{L}(b) = a\cdot \left(\underline{L}\overline{L} (b) \right) = a\cdot b \iff \overline{L} = \underline{L}^{-1}
$$

In spacetime algebra, the Lorentz transformation of a vector $v$ has the canonical form

$$
  \underline{L}(v) = \epsilon_L LvL^{-1}
$$

where $\epsilon_L = 1$ if $L$ is an even multivector and $\epsilon_L = -1$ if $L$ is odd. From the canonical form, it follows that for any multivectors $A$ and $B$

$$
  \underline{L}(AB) = \left(\underline{L}A \right)\left(\underline{L}B \right)
$$

Thus, Lorentz transformations preserve the spacetime product. The determinant of a Lorentz transformation can be found by transforming the pseudoscalar

$$
  \underline{L}(I) = \epsilon_L I \implies \epsilon_L = \det{\underline{L}} = \pm 1
$$

A Lorentz transformation is said to be proper if $\epsilon_L = 1$, and improper if $\epsilon_L = -1$. It is said to be orthochronous if for any timelike vector $v$

$$
  v\cdot \underline{L}(v) > 0
$$

A proper, orthochronous Lorentz transformation is called a Lorentz rotation, and can be written in the canonical form

$$
  \underline{R}(v) = Rv\tilde{R}
$$

for a rotor $R$ satisfying $R\tilde{R} = 1$. Lorentz rotations preserve the geometric product since for any vector $u$ and $v$

$$
  \underline{R}(u)\underline{R}(v) = Ruv\tilde{R} = R(uv)
$$

This implies that the Lorentz rotation can be extended to any multivector $M$ as

$$
  R(M) = RM\tilde{R}
$$

### Reflection

The most elementary form of Lorentz transformations is a reflection in hyperplane with unit normal $n$ given by

$$
  \underline{n}(v) = -nvn^{-1}
$$

If $n$ is spacelike, we require $n^{-1} = -n$ to account for its negative signature. A reflection about a timelike vector $m = m^{-1}$ is called a time reflection and is given by

$$
  \underline{m}(v) = -mvm
$$

Let $n_1, n_2, n_3$ be spacelike vector that compose the trivector $n_3 n_2 n_1 = Im$. A space inversion can be defined as the composite of reflections with respect to these three vectors

$$
  \underline{m}_s (v) = n_3 n_2 n_1 v n_1 n_2 n_3 = ImvmI = mvm
$$

The composite of the time reflection with the space inversion is the spacetime inversion

$$
  \underline{m}_{st}(v) = \underline{m}_s \underline{m}(v) = Im(-mvm)mI = IvI^{-1} = -v
$$

Note that the spacetime inversion is proper, but not orthochronous, so it is not a Lorentz rotation despite the fact that $I$ is even.

### Lorentz rotations

Two types of Lorentz rotations can be obtained from the product of two reflections
- timelike rotations (boosts): $\underline{U}(v) = Uv\tilde{U}$
- spacelike rotations: $\underline{Q}(v) = Qv\tilde{Q}$. 

For a boost, the rotor $U$ can be factored into a product $U = m_2 m_1$ of two unit timelike vectors $m_1$ and $m_2$ in the timelike plane of rotation. This factorization is not unique because for a given $U$ any timelike vector in the plane can be set as $m_1$, and $m_2$ can then be computed from the rotor relation $U = m_2 m_1$. For a spacelike rotation, the rotor $Q$ can similarly be factored into a product $Q = n_2 n_1$ of two unit spacelike vectors in the spacelike plane of rotation. Note that the product of a spacelike vector with a timelike vector is not a rotor, because the corresponding Lorentz transformation is not orthochronous.

Any Lorentz rotation $\underline{R}$ can be decomposed into a product of a timelike and spacelike rotation (with respect to a given timelike vector $v_0 = v_0^{-1}$)

$$
  \underline{R} = \underline{V}\underline{Q}
$$

The timelike and spacelike rotations can be found from $\underline{R}$ by first computing

$$
  v = \underline{R}v_0 = Rv_0\tilde{R}
$$

The timelike vectors $v$ and $v_0$ determine the timelike plane for the boost, defined by

$$
  v = \underline{U}v_0 = U v_0 \tilde{U} = U^2 v_0
$$

This can be solved for

$$
  U = \left( vv_0 \right)^{1/2} = vw = wv_0
$$

where the unit Vector

$$
  w = \frac{v + v_0}{\left| v + v_0 \right|} = \frac{v + v_0}{\left[ 2(1 + v\cdot v_0) \right]^{1/2}}
$$

bisects the angle between $v$ and $v_0$. The rotor $Q$ can then be computed from $Q = \tilde{U}R$ so that the spacelike rotation satisfies

$$
  \underline{Q}v_0 = Q v_0 \tilde{Q} = v_0
$$

Any rotor $R$ can be expressed in the expressed in the exponential form $\pm R = e^{\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{F}}$ where $\mathbf{F} = (\alpha + I\beta)\mathbf{f}$ is a bivector parametrizing the rotation and $\mathbf{f}$ is a timelike unit bivector, i.e. $\mathbf{f}^2 = 1$. Since $\mathbf{f}$ commutes with its dual $I\mathbf{f}$, which is a spacelike bivector, the rotor $R$ can be decomposed into a product of commuting timelike and spacelike rotors

$$
\begin{align*}
  R &= e^{\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{F}} = e^{\frac{1}{2}(\alpha + I\beta)\mathbf{f}} = UQ = QU \\
  U &= e^{\frac{1}{2}\alpha\mathbf{f}} = \cosh\frac{1}{2}\alpha + \mathbf{f}\sinh\frac{1}{2}\alpha \\
  Q &= e^{\frac{1}{2}I\beta\mathbf{f}} = \cos\frac{1}{2}\beta + I\mathbf{f}\sin\frac{1}{2}\beta
\end{align*}
$$

where $\alpha$ is called the rapidity of the boost and $\beta$ is the angular measure of spatial rotation. When $\mathbf{F}^2 = 0$, the rotor reduces to

$$
  R = e^{\frac{1}{2}\alpha\mathbf{f}} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}\alpha\mathbf{f}
$$

The rotor $R$ of this Lorentz transformation can be split into the product $R = UQ$ through a spacetime rotor split such that
- $U^\dagger = \gamma_0 \tilde{U}\gamma_0 = U$ or $\gamma_0\tilde{U} = \gamma_0$
- $Q^\dagger = \gamma_0 \tilde{Q}\gamma_0 = \tilde{Q}$ or $Q\gamma_0 \tilde{Q} = \gamma_0$

### Spacetime split
The Lorentz transformation can be applied to a standard frame $\Set{\gamma_\mu}$ transforming it to a new frame $\Set{e_\mu}$ as

$$
  e_\mu = R\gamma_\mu\tilde{R}
$$

The rotor $R$ of this Lorentz transformation can be split into the product $R = UQ$ through a spacetime rotor split such that
- $U^\dagger = \gamma_0 \tilde{U}\gamma_0 = U$ or $\gamma_0\tilde{U} = U \gamma_0$
- $Q^\dagger = \gamma_0 \tilde{Q}\gamma_0 = \tilde{Q}$ or $Q\gamma_0 \tilde{Q} = \gamma_0$

This splits the Lorentz transformation into a sequence of a spacelike and timelike rotations, determined by $U$ and $Q$ respectively

$$
  e_\mu = R\gamma_\mu\tilde{R} = U\left(Q\gamma_\mu\tilde{Q}\right)\tilde{U}
$$

In particular we obtain

$$
\begin{gather*}
  e_0 = R\gamma_0\tilde{R} =  U\left(Q\gamma_0\tilde{Q}\right)\tilde{U} = U\gamma_0\tilde{U} = U^2\gamma_0 \\
  \iff U^2 = e_0 \gamma_0
\end{gather*}
$$

This determines $U$ uniquely in terms of the timelike vectors $e_0$ and $\gamma_0$, which, in turn, uniquely determines the split $R = LU$, because $U$ can be computed from $U = \tilde{L}R$.

## Lorentz group

The bivector commutator bracket $[\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{G}] := \langle\mathbf{F}\mathbf{G}\rangle$ makes the bivectors a closed non-associative Lie algebra. Denoting $\mathbf{K}_i = \gamma_{i0} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i$ for the timelike bivectors and $\mathbf{S}_i = -\epsilon_{ijk}\gamma_{jk} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i I^{-1}$ for the spacelike bivectors

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \mathbf{K}_1 &= \gamma_{10} \\
  \mathbf{K}_2 &= \gamma_{20} \\
  \mathbf{K}_3 &= \gamma_{30}
\end{aligned}\quad
\begin{aligned}
  \mathbf{S}_1 &= \gamma_{23} \\
  \mathbf{S}_2 &= \gamma_{31} \\
  \mathbf{S}_3 &= \gamma_{12}
\end{aligned}
$$

the bracket relations simplify to

$$
  \left[\mathbf{S}_i, \mathbf{S}_j \right] = \epsilon_{ijk}\mathbf{S}_k \quad \left[\mathbf{K}_i, \mathbf{K}_j \right] = -\epsilon_{ijk}\mathbf{S}_k \quad \left[\mathbf{S}_i, \mathbf{K}_j \right] = \epsilon_{ijk}\mathbf{K}_k
$$

These are precisely the Lie bracket relations that define the generators for the Lorentz group. The spacelike bivectors $\mathbf{S}_i$ generate spatial rotations, while timelike bivectors $\mathbf{K}_i$ generate hyperbolic rotations (boosts). Exponentiating the commutator bracket of a bivector produces a restricted (proper, orthochronous) Lorentz transformation that is continuously connected to the identity. The rotational bivectors $\mathbf{S}_i$ are related to the imaginary quaternion elements by 

$$
  \mathbf{i} := \mathbf{S}_1 = \boldsymbol{\sigma}_1 I^{-1} \quad \mathbf{j} := \mathbf{S}_2 = \boldsymbol{\sigma}_2 I^{-1} \quad \mathbf{i} := \mathbf{S}_3 = \boldsymbol{\sigma}_3 I^{-1}
$$

with $\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}\mathbf{k} = -1$. The odd change in sign for $\mathbf{j}$ lingers from Hamilton's original definition of the quaternion basis as a left-handed set.

The rotation of a bivector $\mathbf{F}$ by an angle in the plane $\mathbf{S}_3 = \boldsymbol{\sigma}_3 I^{-1}$ is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \exp\left(\theta\left[ \mathbf{S}_3, \cdot \right]\right)\mathbf{F} &= \mathbf{F} + \theta\left[ \mathbf{S}_3, \mathbf{F} \right] + \frac{\theta^2}{2}\left[ \mathbf{S}_3, \left[ \mathbf{S}_3, \mathbf{F} \right] \right] + \dots \\
  &= \exp\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\mathbf{S}_3 \right)\mathbf{F}\exp\left(-\frac{\theta}{2}\mathbf{S}_3 \right) \\
  &= \exp\left(-\frac{\theta}{2}I\boldsymbol{\sigma}_3 \right)\mathbf{F} \exp\left(\frac{\theta}{2}I\boldsymbol{\sigma}_3 \right)
\end{align*}
$$

The boost to a frame with timelike vector $\gamma_0$ from a different frame moving at a relative velocity $\mathbf{v} = |v|\boldsymbol{\sigma}_3$ wrt. $\gamma_0$ is given by

$$
  \mathbf{F}' = \exp\left(-\alpha\left[\boldsymbol{\sigma}_3, \cdot \right] \right)\mathbf{F} = e^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_3}\mathbf{F}e^{\frac{\alpha}{2}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_3}
$$

where the proper hyperbolic angle (rapidity) for the boost is determined by the magnitude of the velocity, i.e. $\alpha = \atanh\left(\frac{|v|}{c}\right)$. To simplify the expression, we decompose $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F}_\parallel + \mathbf{F}_\perp$ wrt. to $\mathbf{v}$ such that

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{F}' &= e^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_3}\mathbf{F}e^{\frac{\alpha}{2}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_3} \\
  &= \mathbf{F}_\parallel + e^{-\alpha\boldsymbol{\sigma}_3}\mathbf{F}_\perp \\
  &= \mathbf{F}_\parallel + \exp\left[-\atanh\left(\frac{|v|}{c}\right) \boldsymbol{\sigma}_3\right]\mathbf{F}_\perp \\
  &= \mathbf{F}_\parallel + \left[\cosh\left(\atanh\left(\frac{|v|}{c}\right)\right) + \sinh\left(\atanh\left(\frac{|v|}{c}\right)\right) \boldsymbol{\sigma}_3\right]\mathbf{F}_\perp \\
  &= \mathbf{F}_\parallel + \frac{1 - \mathbf{v}/c}{\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}\mathbf{F}_\perp
\end{align*}
$$

where the boost dilation factor $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ only scale the perpendicular part of $\mathbf{F}$. If we make a spacetime split $\mathbf{F}_\perp = \vec{E}_\perp + \vec{B}_\perp I$, the Lorentz boosted version is

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{F}_\perp' &= \gamma(1 - \mathbf{v}/c)\mathbf{F}_\perp = \gamma(1 - \mathbf{v}/c)\left( \vec{E}_\perp + \vec{B}_\perp I \right) \\
  &= \gamma\left[ \left(\vec{E}_\perp + \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c}\times\vec{B}_\perp \right) + \left( \vec{B} - \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c}\times\vec{E}_\perp \right)I \right]
\end{align*}
$$

where we have simplified the bivector products $\mathbf{v}\vec{E} = \mathbf{v}\times\vec{E}_\perp I$ since $\mathbf{v}\cdot\vec{E} = 0$ (and similarly for $\vec{B}_\perp$). This transformation correspond to a Lorentz-boosted electromagnetic field.

## Physical quantities

All proper physical quantities in spacetime must either correspond to pure $k$-blades, or multivectors that combine $k$-blades of differing grades as these are the only frame-independent objects permitted by the constraints of special relativity.

# Spacetime calculus

## Vector derivative

Expanding a spacetime point $x$ into coordinates $x = x^\mu\gamma_\mu$, then a proper vector derivative can be defined using the reciprocal basis $\gamma^\mu$

$$
\begin{gather*}
  \nabla := \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \\
  \partial_\mu := \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu} = \gamma_\mu \cdot \nabla
\end{gather*}
$$

the square of $\nabla$ is the d'Alembertian

$$
  \nabla^2 = \eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu \partial_\nu
$$

The matrix representation of $\nabla$ can be recognized as the Dirac operator used in the Dirac equation. Since $\nabla$ is a vector operator, it can be expanded into

$$
  \nabla F = \nabla\cdot F + \nabla\wedge F
$$

The directional derivative along a vector $v$ is defined as

$$
  v\cdot\nabla F = v\cdot\partial_x F(x) = \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}F(x + v\tau)\right|_{\tau = 0} = \lim_{\tau\to 0}\frac{F(x + v\tau) - F(x)}{\tau}
$$

where $F(x)$ is any multivector-valued function. The general vector derivative can be obtained from the directional derivative

$$
  \nabla F = \partial_x F(x) = \partial_v v \cdot\partial_x F(x)
$$

The directional derivative produces from $F$ a tensor field called the differential of $F$

$$
  F(a) = F_a := a\cdot\nabla F
$$

the second differential $F_b (a) = F_{ab}$ is defined by

$$
  F_b (a) := b\cdot F(a) - F(b\cdot\nabla a) = b\cdot\grave{\nabla}\grave{F}(a)
$$

and has the symmetry property

$$
  F_b (a) = F_a (b)
$$

This can be expressed as an operator identity

$$
  (a\wedge b)\cdot(\nabla\wedge\nabla) = [a\cdot\nabla, b\cdot\nabla] = 0
$$

Differentiation by $\partial_a$ and $\partial_b$ puts this identity in the form

$$
  \nabla\wedge\nabla = 0
$$

### Common vector derivatives

Product rule

$$
  \nabla\cdot(a\wedge b) = \grave{\nabla}\cdot\left(\grave{a}\wedge b\right) + \grave{\nabla}\cdot\left(a\wedge\grave{b}\right)
$$

The following is a list of the most common vector derivatives, where $a$ is a vector and $A$ a $k$-blade, both independent of the position $x$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  &\nabla (x\cdot a) = a\cdot\nabla x = a \\
  &\nabla \left|x\right|^2 = \nabla x^2 = 2x \\
  &\nabla\wedge x = 0 \\
  &\nabla x = \nabla\cdot x = 4 \\
  &\nabla\left|x\right|^n = n|x|^{n-2} x
\end{aligned}\quad
\begin{aligned}
  &\nabla (x\cdot A) = A\cdot\nabla x = kA \\
  &\nabla (x\wedge A) = A\wedge\nabla x = (4 - k)A \\
  &\nabla(Ax) = \gamma^\mu A \gamma_\mu = (-1)^k (4 - 2k)A \\
  &\nabla\left(\frac{x}{|x|^k}\right) = \frac{4 - k}{|x|^k}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Tangential derivative

The derivative can be restricted along any $k$-blade $M = \langle M \rangle_k$. Specifically, the tangential derivative along $M$ is defined as

$$
  \nabla_M = M^{-1}(M\cdot\nabla)
$$

When $M$ is a unit vector $a$, then $a = a^{-1}$, so the tangential derivative recovers the usual directional derivative from vector calculus. Similarly, the complementary derivative is

$$
  \nabla_{MI^{-1}} = M^{-1}(M\wedge\nabla)
$$

which computes the derivative along the orthogonal surface $MI^{-1}$ dual to $M$. The total derivative decomposes into a sum of these complementary derivatives $\nabla = \nabla_M + \delta_{MI^{-1}}$ since

$$
  M^{-1}(M\cdot\nabla) + M^{-1}(M\wedge\nabla) = \left( M^{-1} M \right)\nabla = \nabla
$$

Tangential derivatives can be used to decompose the derivative in terms of a frame relative to $\gamma_0$ by using tangential derivatives

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla &= \left(\nabla_{\gamma_0} + \nabla_{\gamma_0 I^{-1}} \right) \\
  &= \gamma_0\left(\gamma_0 \cdot \right) + \gamma_0 \left(\gamma_0 \wedge \nabla \right) \\
  &= \gamma_0\left(\partial_0 + \vec{\nabla} \right) = \left(\partial_0 - \vec{\nabla} \right)\gamma_0
\end{align*}
$$

The frame-dependent 3-vector derivative

$$
  \vec{\nabla} = \gamma_0 \wedge \nabla = \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i \partial_i
$$

is the standard gradient operator from vector analysis. Squaring $\nabla$ gives the d'Alembertian operator

$$
  \nabla^2 =\left( \partial_0 - \vec{\nabla} \right)\gamma_0^2 \left( \partial_0 + \vec{\nabla} \right) = \partial_0^2 - \vec{\nabla}^2
$$

### Field derivatives

The derivative of a scalar field $\alpha(x)$ produces the total gradient vector field

$$
  \nabla\alpha(x) = \gamma_0 \left[\partial_0\alpha(x) + \vec{\nabla}\alpha(x)\right]
$$

Taking the dual of this derivative produces the derivative of a pseudoscalar field $\alpha(x)I$. The derivative of a complex scalar field $\zeta(x) = \alpha(x) + \beta(x)I$ is a complex vector field $z(x) = \nabla\zeta(x) = \nabla\alpha(x) + \left[\nabla\beta(x) \right]I$.

The derivative of a vector field $v(x) = \left[v_0 (x) + \vec{v}(x) \right]\gamma_0$ produces a scalar field and a bivector (spinor) field

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla v(x) &= \nabla\cdot v(x) + \nabla\wedge v(x) \\
  &= \left( \partial_0 - \vec{\nabla} \right)\gamma_0^2 (v_0 - \vec{v}) \\
  &= \left[ \partial_0 v_0 + \vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{v} \right] + \left[-\left(\partial_0 \vec{v} + \vec{\nabla}v_0 + \vec{\nabla}\times\vec{v}I\right) \right]
\end{align*}
$$

The scalar part $\nabla\cdot v$ is the total divergence of $v(x)$, while the bivector part $\nabla\wedge v$ is the proper generalization of the curl of $v(x)$ to spacetime. Taking the dual of this derivative produces the derivative of a trivector field $v(x)I$, which produces a pseudoscalar field and a bivector field. Taking the derivative of a complex vector field $z(x) = a(x) + b(x)I$ generally produces a spinor field 

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla z(x) &= \nabla\cdot z(x) + \nabla\wedge z(x) \\
  &= \nabla\cdot a(x) + \left[\nabla\cdot b(x)\right]I + \nabla\wedge a(x) + \left[\nabla\wedge b(x)\right]I \\
  &= \zeta(x) + \mathbf{F}(x)
\end{align*}
$$

The derivative of a bivector field $\mathbf{F}(x) = \vec{E}(x) + \vec{B}(x)I$ produces a vector field and a trivector field

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla\mathbf{F}(x) &= \nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}(x) + \nabla\wedge\mathbf{F}(x) \\
  &= \gamma_0 \left(\partial_0 + \vec{\nabla}\right)\left(\vec{E} + \vec{B}I \right) \\
  &= \gamma_0 \left[ \vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{E} + \partial_0\vec{E} - \vec{\nabla}\times\vec{B} \right] + \gamma_0 \left[\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{B} + \partial_0\vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times\vec{E}\right]I
\end{align*}
$$

which represents a single complex vector field. Using the canonical form $\mathbf{F}(x) = \mathbf{f}(x)e^{\left[\varphi(x) + \varphi_0 \right] I}$, the derivative can be expressed as

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla\mathbf{F}(x) &= \nabla\left[ \mathbf{f}(x) e^{\left[\varphi(x) + \varphi_0 \right]I} \right] \\
  &= \left[\nabla\mathbf{f}(x) \right]e^{\left[\varphi(x) + \varphi_0\right]I} + \left[\nabla\varphi(x) \right]\mathbf{F}(x)I
\end{align*}
$$

## Directed integration

Each point $x = x^\mu\gamma_\mu$ on the oriented spacetime manifold corresponds to an oriented $4$-volume $\mathrm{d}^4 x = \mathrm{d}x_0 \wedge \mathrm{d}x_1 \wedge \mathrm{d}x_2 \wedge \mathrm{d}x_3$ that can be decomposed into differentials $\mathrm{d}x_\mu = |\mathrm{d}x|\gamma_\mu$ pointing along the coordinate directions. We can then define directed integration on the manifold as a Riemann summation of multivector products over a particular region $S_k$ of dimension $k$. This is done by enclosing each point $x\in S_k$ in a finite oriented $k$-volume $\Delta^k x = |\Delta x|^k I_k$ where $I_k = \bigwedge_j \gamma_j$ is the unit $k$-volume element that encodes the orientation of the region $S_k$ at the point $x$. Computing a weighted sum over all these points in the limit of a vanishing bounding interval $|\Delta x|$ gives the directed integral

$$
  \int_{S_k} M_1(x)\;\mathrm{d}^k x \; M_2 (x) = \lim_{|\Delta x|\to 0} \sum_{x\in S_k} M_1(x)\Delta^k x M_2(x)
$$

The noncommutativity of the multivectors $M_1 (x)$ and $M_2 (x)$ with the directed volume segment $\mathrm{d}^k x$ permits both right and left products in the integrand.

### Generalized Stokes' theorem

The generalized Stokes's theorem, also known as the fundamental theorem of integral calculus, states that the boundary integral is equal to the volume integral of the derivative

$$
  \int_{S_k} M_1 (x)\;\mathrm{d}^k x \nabla_{S_k} M_2(x) = \int_{\partial S_k} M_1 (x)\;\mathrm{d}x^{k-1} x M_2 (x)
$$

### Cauchy integral theorem

For any field $M(x)$ satisfying $\nabla_{S_2} M(x) = 0$ everywhere in a closed planar region $S_2$, the boundary integral vanishes

$$
  \oint_{\partial S_2} \mathrm{d}x\;M(x) = 0
$$

The Green's function that inverts the planar derivative is $\Delta_{S_2}\left[2\pi \left(x - x' \right)\right] = \delta\left(x - x'\right)$. If $N(x) = \alpha_{-1}x^{-1} + M(x)$ is a modification of $M(x)$ that adds a pole, then we obtain the residue theorem

$$
  \oint_{\partial S_2} \mathrm{d}x\;N(x) = \alpha_{-1} \int_{S_2} \left| \mathrm{d}^2 x \right| \mathbf{I}_2 \nabla_{S_2} x^{-1} = 2\pi\mathbf{I}_2 \alpha_{-1}
$$

where $\mathbf{I}_2$ is the unit bivector for $S_2$ that squares to $-1$. Multiplying $M(x)$ with the Green's function and then integrating produces the remaining Cauchy integral theorem

$$
  \oint_{\partial S_2} \mathrm{d}x \left(x - x' \right)^{-1} M(x) = \int_{S_2} \mathbf{I}_2 \left| \mathrm{d}^2 x \right| \nabla\left( x - x' \right)^{-1} M(x) = 2\pi\mathbf{I}_2 M(x')
$$
