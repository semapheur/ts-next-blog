# Physical theory

A physical theory has three basic ingredients:
- spacetime
- ontology
- dynamics

*Spacetime* is a set endowed with geometrical structure combining physical space and time into a four-dimensional continuum. The elements of spacetime are called *events*. Classical spacetimes have separate spatial and temporal metrics, implying absolute spatial and temporal distances. Relativistic spacetimes have a single spatiotemporal metric, implying relative spatial and temporal distances. The *ontology* of a physical theory are the objects and their properties posited to exist by the theory. These objects are connected to spacetime. The *dynamics* describes how the ontology is allowed to behave.

# Galilean spacetime

A *Galilean spacetime* is a pair $(\mathcal{A}^4, V)$, where
- $\mathcal{A}^4$ is a $4$-dimensional affine space of events
- $V$ is its transltion vectors

The elements of $\mathcal{A}^4$ are called *events*. A *wordline* of a particle is an affine map $\gamma:\R\to\mathcal{A}^4$. Uniform motion corresponds to affine lines in $\mathcal{A}^4$.

A Galilean structure on $\mathcal{A}^4$ is a triple $(\tau, \rho, \braket{\cdot, \cdot})$ consisting of:

---
1. **A non-trivial linear time funtional (absolute time)** 

A non-zero linear functional $\ell: V\to\R$ is called the *time functional*. The time length of a vector $\mathbf{w}\in V$ is $\ell(\mathbf{w})$. For any chosen origin $O\in\mathcal{A}^4$, the functional $\ell$ induces an affine time function $\tau_O: \mathcal{A}\to\R$ defined by 

$$
	\tau_O (A) := \ell(\vec{OA})
$$ 

Changing the origin adds a constant, so $\tau$ is defined only up to additive constants. For events $A, B\in\mathcal{A}^4$

$$
	\tau(B) - \tau(A) = \ell(\vec{AB})
$$

is the oriented time separation between $A$ and $B$.

2. **Spacelike subspaces (spaces of simultaneity)**

For each $a\in\R$, the *simultaneity slice* $\mathcal{A}_a^3 := \tau^{-1} (A)$ is a $3$-dimensional affine subspace of $\mathcal{A}^4$. It translations space is $W := \operatorname{ker}(\ell) \subset V$, a $3$-dimensional vector subspace. Vectors in $W$ are called spacelike, while vectors with $\ell(w) \neq 0$ are timelike.

3. **A Euclidean metric on each slice**

A Galilean structure specifies
- a fixed inner product $\braket{\cdot, \cdot}: W\times W\to\R$
- the induced Euclidean distance on each simultaneity slice $\rho: \mathcal{A}_a^3 \times \mathcal{A}_a^3 \to\R$ defined by

$$
	\rho(A_1, A_2) := \norm{\vec{A_1 A_2}} = \sqrt{\braket{\vec{A_1 A_2}, \vec{A_1 A_2}}}
$$

This is well-defined because $\tau(A_1) = \tau(A_2)$ implies $\vec{A_1 A_2} \in W$.
---

We also fix an orientation on each $\mathcal{A}_a^3$ such that translations between simultaneity slices induced by timelike vectors preserve orientation and Euclidean structure. That is, for any $A, B \in\mathcal{A}^4$, the translation map $T_{\vec{AB}} : \mathcal{A}_{\tau(A)}^3 \to \mathcal{A}_{\tau(B)}^3$ given by

$$
	X \mapsto X + \vec{AB}
$$

is required to be an orientation-preserving Euclidean isometry.

A Galilean spacetime can be equally specified as $(\mathcal{A}^4, \ell, \braket{\cdot,\cdot})$, since any non-trivial linear functional $\ell: V\to\R$ determines
- the induced time separation: $\tau(A, B) := \ell(\vec{AB})$
- an affine time coordinate $\tau_O (A) = \ell(\vec{OA})$
- and, once an inner product on $\operatorname{ker}(\ell)$ is chosen, the full Galilean structure $(\mathcal{A}^4, \ell, \rho)$

## Galilean relativity

1. All the laws of nature at all moments of time are the same in all inertial coordinate systems.
2. A coordinate system in uniform rectilinear motion with respect to an inertial one is also inertial.
