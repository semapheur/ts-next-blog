### Time-harmonic Maxwell equations

The fundamental electromagnetic equations in differential form are

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla\times\mathbf{E} =& -\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \tag{\label{equation-12}} \\
  \nabla\times\mathbf{H} =& \frac{\partial\mathbf{D}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{J}_\text{t} \tag{\label{equation-13}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\mathbf{D} =& \rho_\text{t} \tag{\label{equation-14}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} =& 0 \tag{\label{equation-15}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}_\text{t} =& -\frac{\partial\rho_\text{t}}{\partial t} \tag{\label{equation-16}}
\end{align*}
$$

where the first four are Maxwell's equations and the last is the continuity equation.

If the impressed sources $\rho_\text{t} (\mathbf{r}, t)$ and $\mathbf{J}_\text{t} (\mathbf{r}, t)$ vary sinusoidally at radian frequency $\omega > 0$, then linearity of Maxwell's equation all fields will respond sinusoidally at the same frequency. The fundamental electromagnetic equations are considerably simplified by introducing phasor fields of the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t) =& \Re(\tilde{\mathbf{E}}(\mathbf{r}) e^{j\omega t}) \\
  \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{r}, t) =& \Re(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}(\mathbf{r}) e^{j\omega t})
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-11}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the phasor quantities $\tilde{\mathbf{E}}$, $\tilde{\mathbf{H}}$, $\tilde{\mathbf{D}}$, $\tilde{\mathbf{B}}$, are complex vector fields and $\tilde{\rho}_\text{T}$ is a complex scalar field, all depending only on spatial coordinates. Substituting $\eqref{equation-11}$ into $\eqref{equation-12}$-$\eqref{equation-16}$ and eliminating the phase factors $e^{j\omega t}$ yields the time-harmonic Maxwell system

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{E}} =& -j\omega\tilde{\mathbf{B}} \tag{\label{equation-17}} \\
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{H}} =& j\omega\mathbf{D} + \tilde{\mathbf{J}}_\text{t} \tag{\label{equation-18}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{D}} =& \rho_\text{t} \tag{\label{equation-19}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{B}} =& 0 \tag{\label{equation-20}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{J}}_\text{t} =& -j\omega \tilde{\rho}_\text{t} \tag{\label{equation-21}}
\end{align*}
$$

If multiple frequency is present, the full time-domain solution can be recovered by inverse Fourier transform of phasor solutions.

The total current density $\tilde{\mathbf{J}}$ decomposes into a conduction current and an impressed current

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{J}}_\text{t} = \sigma\tilde{\mathbf{E}} + \tilde{\mathbf{J}}
\tag{\label{equation-22}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\sigma \geq 0$ is the conductity. The current density $\sigma\tilde{\mathbf{E}}$ is induced on a nearby conductor due to the fields created by the source $\mathbf{J}_s$. In addition to conductivity $\sigma$, a material is further characterized by permittivity $\varepsilon$ and permeability $\mu$. For isotropic, homogenous media we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{D}} =& \varepsilon\tilde{\mathbf{E}} \tag{\label{equation-23}} \\
  \tilde{\mathbf{B}} =& \mu\tilde{\mathbf{B}} \tag{\label{equation-24}}
\end{align*}
$$

Substituting $\eqref{equation-22}$ and $\eqref{equation-23}$ into $\eqref{equation-18}$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{H}} =& j\omega\left(\varepsilon + \frac{\sigma}{j\omega} \right) \tilde{\mathbf{E}} + \tilde{\mathbf{J}} \\
  =& j\omega\varepsilon' \tilde{\mathbf{E}} + \tilde{\mathbf{J}}
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-25}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where we have introduce the complex permittivity $\varepsilon' = \varepsilon - j(\sigma/\omega)$. Let $\rho$ be the source charge corresponding to the source current density $\tilde{\mathbf{J}}$. Then using $\eqref{equation-22}$ to $\eqref{equation-25}$ in $\eqref{equation-17}$ and $\eqref{equation-19}$ to $\eqref{equation-11}$, and repeating $\eqref{equation-25}$ permits Maxwell's equations to be expressed in terms of $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{H}$

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{E}} =& -j\omega\mu\tilde{\mathbf{H}} \tag{\label{equation-26}} \\
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{H}} =& -j\omega\varepsilon' \tilde{\mathbf{E}} + \tilde{\mathbf{J}} \tag{\label{equation-27}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{E}} =& \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon'} \tag{\label{equation-28}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{H}} =& 0 \tag{\label{equation-29}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{J}} =& -j\omega\rho \tag{\label{equation-30}}
\end{align*}
$$

Introducing a fictitious magnetic current density $\mathbf{M}$, we can rewrite $\eqref{equation-26}$ as

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{E}} = -j\omega\mu\tilde{\mathbf{H}} - \mathbf{M}
\tag{\label{equation-31}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Magnetic currents are useful as equivalent sources that replace complicated electric fields. 

Across an interface between two homogenous media with constitutive parameters $\varepsilon_k$, $\mu_k$, $\sigma_k$ for $k = 1,2$, the time-harmonic boundary conditions are

$$
\begin{align*}
  \unitvec{n}\times(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_2 - \tilde{\mathbf{H}}_1) =& \mathbf{J}_s \\
  (\tilde{\mathbf{E}}_2 - \tilde{\mathbf{E}}_1) \times\unitvec{n} =& \mathbf{M}_s
\end{align*}
$$

where $\unitvec{n}$ is the unit normal directed from medium $1$ into medium $2$, and $\mathbf{J}_s$ and $\mathbf{M}_s$ denote electric and magnetic surface currents. The magnetic suface current $\mathbf{M}_s$ is zero unless an equivalent magnetic current sheet is used. The cross product with the unit normal form the tangential components to the boundary

$$
\begin{align*}
  H_{\text{tan},2} =& H_{\text{tan},1} + J_s \\
  E_{\text{tan},2} =& E_{\text{tan},1} + M_s
\end{align*}
$$

These boundary conditions are derived from the integral form of $\eqref{equation-27}$ and $\eqref{equation-31}$. If one side is a perfect electrical conductor, the boundary conditions become

$$
\begin{align*}
  H_\text{tan} =& J_s \\
  E_\text{tan} =& 0
\end{align*}
$$

### Poynting's theorem

Consider a volume $\nu \subseteq\R^3$ bounded by a closed surface $s = \partial\nu$. By Poynting's theorem the complex power balance is

$$
  P_s = P_f + \braket{P_d} + j2\omega(\braket{W_m} - \braket{W_e})
$$

where
- $P_s$ is the complex power delivered by impressed sources
- $P_f$ is the outward complex power flux
- $\braket{P_d}$ is the time-averaged dissipated power 
- $\braket{W_m}$, $\braket{W_e}$ are time-averaged stored magnetic and electric energies

The complex power flowing out of through the closed surface $s$ is given by

$$
  P_f} = \frac{1}{2} \oiint_s \tilde{\mathbf{E}} \times \tilde{\mathbf{H}}^* \cdot \d\mathbf{s}
$$

where $\d\mathbf{s} = \d s \unitvec{n}$ and $\unitvec{n}$ is the unit normal to the surface directed out from the surface. The integrand is defined as the Poynting vector

$$
  \mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{2} \tilde{\mathbf{E}} \times\tilde{\mathbf{H}}^*
$$

which is a power density with units $\text{W}/\text{m}^2$.

The dissipated power and stored energies are

$$
\begin{align*}
  \braket{P_d} =& \frac{1}{2} \iiint_\nu \sigma |\tilde{E}|^2 \;\d\nu \\
  \braket{W_m} =& \frac{1}{2} \iiint_\nu \frac{1}{2} \mu |\tilde{H}|^2 \;\d\nu \\
  \braket{W_e} =& \frac{1}{2} \iiint_\nu \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon' |\tilde{E}|^2 \;\d\nu
\end{align*}
$$

If the source distribution is known, the complex source power can be computed directly from

$$
\begin{equation*}
  P_s = -\frac{1}{2} \iiint_\nu \tilde{\mathbf{E}} \cdot\tilde{\mathbf{J}}^* \;\d\nu
\tag{\label{equation-71}}
\end{equation*}
$$

with an additional contribution $\frac{1}{2} \iiint_\nu \tilde{\mathbf{H}}^* \cdot \tilde{\mathbf{M}} \;\d\nu$ if magnetic current density is present.

The real power flowing through an arbitray surface $s$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \braket{P} = \Re\left(\iint_s \mathbf{S} \cdot \d\mathbf{s} \right)
\tag{\label{equation-84}}
\end{equation*}
$$

### Radiation fields

The antenna problem consist of solving for the electromagnetic fields that are created by an impressed current distribution $\tilde{\mathbf{J}}$. The fields $\tilde{\mathbf{E}}$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{H}}$ are determined by the curl equations $\eqref{equation-26}$ and $\eqref{equation-27}$, which are two coupled linear first-order differential equation. In order to simplify the solution for $\tilde{\mathbf{E}}$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{H}}$ with a given $\tilde{\mathbf{J}}$, we introduce the scalar potential $\Phi$ and the vector potential $\mathbf{A}$.

By $\eqref{equation-29}$, the magnetic field is divergenceless allowing us to define $\tilde{\mathbf{H}}$ as the curl of a magnetic vector potential $\mathbf{A}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{H}} = \frac{1}{\mu} \nabla\times\mathbf{A}
\tag{\label{equation-32}}
\end{equation*}
$$

since $\nabla\cdot\nabla\times\mathbf{A} \equiv 0$ for any $\mathbf{A}$. The scalar potential is derived by substituting $\eqref{equation-32}$ into $\eqref{equation-26}$ resulting in

$$
  \nabla\times(\tilde{\mathbf{E}} + j\omega\mathbf{A}) = \mathbf{0}
$$

Since the expression in the parentheses is curl free, it is a conservative field and behaves as a static electric field. The electric scalar potential $\Phi$ is defined from

$$
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}} + j\omega\mathbf{A} = -\nabla\Phi
$$
 
which satisfies $\nabla \times (-\nabla\Phi) \equiv \mathbf{0}$. The electric field can be written

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}} = -j\omega\mathbf{A} -\nabla\Phi
\tag{\label{equation-33}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting $\eqref{equation-32}$ into $\eqref{equation-27}$ gives

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{H}} =& \frac{1}{\mu} \nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{A} \\
  =& j\omega\varepsilon' \tilde{\mathbf{E}} + \tilde{\mathbf{J}}
\end{align*}
$$

Using the vector identity $\eqref{equation-63}$ and inserting $\eqref{equation-33}$ we obtain

$$
  \nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = j\omega\mu\varepsilon' \Phi + \nabla\cdot\mathbf{A} + \mu\tilde{\mathbf{J}}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} + \omega^2 \mu\varepsilon' \mathbf{A} - \nabla(j\omega\mu\varepsilon' \Phi + \nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}) = -\mu\tilde{\mathbf{J}}
\tag{\label{equation-34}}
\end{equation*}
$$

To eliminate the gradient term of $\eqref{equation-34}$ we can use the Lorentz condition

$$
  \nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}= -j\omega\mu\varepsilon' \Phi
$$

so that $\eqref{equation-34}$ simplifies to

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} + \omega^2 \mu\varepsilon' \mathbf{A} = -\mu\tilde{\mathbf{J}}
\tag{\label{equation-35}}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is known as the vector wave equation. Solving for $\mathbf{A}$ we can determine the electric field from

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}} = -j\omega\mathbf{A} - j\frac{\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A})}{\omega\mu\varepsilon'}
\tag{\label{equation-64}}
\end{equation*}
$$

A more cumbersome approach would be to solve the scalar wave equation

$$
  \nabla^2 \Phi + \omega^2 \mu\varepsilon' \Phi = -\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon'}
$$

in addition to the vector wave equation.

From $\eqref{equation-35}$ we recognize the coefficient $\beta = \omega\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon'}$ as the phase constant for a propagating wave. By definition a wave shift $2\pi$ radians of phase for one full cycle, corresponding to one wavelength $\lambda$, so that

$$
  \beta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
$$

since $\lambda = c/f$ and $\omega = 2\pi f$, we have

$$
  \beta = \frac{2\pi f}{c} = \frac{\omega}{c}
$$

implying that $c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon'}}$.

For a point source, the wave equation takes the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla^2 \psi + \beta^2 = -\delta(x) \delta(y) \delta(z)
\tag{\label{equation-36}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\psi$ is the response to a point source at the origin, and $\delta$ is the Dirac delta function. Despite the infinitesimal extent of a point source, its associated current has a direction. If the point source current is taken as $z$-directed, then

$$
  \psi = A_z
$$

Because the point source is zero except at the origin $\eqref{equation-36}$ becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla^2 \psi + \beta^2 \psi = 0
\tag{\label{equation-37}}
\end{equation*}
$$

away from the origin. This is the complex scalar wave equation, also known as the Helmholtz equation. Due to spherical symmetry, the Laplacian is written in spherical coordinates and $\psi$ has only radial dependence. The two solutions to $\eqref{equation-37}$ are $e^{\pm j\beta r} / r$, which correspond to waves propagating radially outward and inward, respectively. The physically meaningful solution is the one for waves traveling away from the point source, resulting in

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \psi = \frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{4\pi r}
\tag{\label{equation-38}}
\end{equation*}
$$

With respect to an observation point $P$ at an arbitrary position $\mathbf{r}'$, the position of the point source is $\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}$, so that $\eqref{equation-38}$ is given in terms of $R = |\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}|$, i.e.

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \psi = \frac{e^{-j\beta R}}{4\pi R}
\tag{\label{equation-39}}
\end{equation*}
$$

If we consider the source to be a collection of point sources weighted by the distribution $\tilde{\mathbf{J}}$, the response $\mathbf{A}$ is a sum of the point source responses of $\eqref{equation-39}$. This is expressed by the integal over the source volume $\nu'$

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{A} = \iiint_{\nu'} \mu \tilde{\mathbf{J}} \frac{e^{-j\beta R}}{4\pi R} \;\d\nu'
\tag{\label{equation-40}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Having determined $\mathbf{A}$, we can compute $\tilde{\mathbf{H}}$ from $\eqref{equation-32}$. The electric field is then given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}} = \frac{1}{j\omega\varepsilon'} (\nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{H}} - \tilde{\mathbf{J}})
\tag{\label{equation-42}}
\end{equation*}
$$

### The ideal dipole

An ideal (Hertzian) dipole of length $l$ is a radiating element that is electrically small compared to the wavelength, i.e. $l \ll \lambda$. It is ideal in the sense that the current is uniform in both magnitude and phase along its length, with no end effects. Any practical antenna can be decomposed into infinitesimal current elements, which can be modeled as dipoles. The fields from the antenna are given as a suporposition of fields from the the ideal dipoles. For instance, a short center-fed wire antenna has a sinusoidal current tapering to zero at the ends, but has the same radiation pattern as an ideal dipole.

Consider a current element of length $\Delta z$ along the $z$-axis, centered at the origin, carrying a uniform current $I$. The current density is

$$
  \tilde{\mathbf{J}}(\mathbf{r}') = I \delta(x') \delta(y') \unitvec(z), \; z' \in\left(-\frac{\Delta z}{2}, \frac{\Delta z}{2}\right)
$$

Substituting this into $\eqref{equation-40}$ simplifies the volume integral for the vector potential to the one-dimensional integral

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{A} =& \unitvec{z} \mu I \int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(x') \;\d x' \int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(y') \;\d y' \int_{-\Delta z/2}^{\Delta z/2} \frac{e^{-j\beta R}}{4\pi R} \;\d z' \\
  =& \unitvec{z} \mu I \int_{-\Delta z/2}^{\Delta z/2} \frac{e^{-j\Beta R}}{4\pi R} \;\d z' \tag{\label{equation-41}}
\end{align*}
$$

For small $\Delta z \ll \lambda$, we approximate $R = |\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}| \approx |\mathbf{r}| = r$. With this approximation, the integral $\eqref{equation-41}$ evaluates to

$$
  \mathbf{A} = \frac{\mu I e^{-j\beta r}}{4\pi r} \Delta z \unitvec{z} = A_z \unitvec{z}
$$

This is exact of a point current element and an adequate approximation for a small but finite current element.

The magnetic field of the ideal dipole is given by

$$
  \tilde{\mathbf{H}} = \frac{1}{\mu} \nabla\times\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{\mu} \nabla\times (A_z \unitvec{z})
$$

Applying the vector identity $\eqref{equation-59}$, we get

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{H}} =& \frac{1}{\mu} (\nabla A_z) \times\unitvec{z} + \frac{1}{\mu} A_z \underbrace{(\nabla\times\unitvec{z})}_{=\mathbf{0}} \\
  =& \frac{1}{\mu} (\nabla A_z) \times\unitvec{z} = \nabla\left(\frac{I\Delta z e^{-j\beta r}}{4\pi r}\right) \times\unitvec{z}
\end{align*}
$$

Taking the gradient of $A_z$, which only depends on $r$, in spherical coordinates using $\eqref{equation-60}$, we get

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{H}} =& \frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{r} \right) \unitvec{r}\times\unitvec{z} \\
  =& \frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi} \left(\frac{-j\beta e^{-j\beta r}}{r} - \frac{e^{j\beta r}}{r^2} \right) \unitvec{r}\times\unitvec{z} \tag{\label{equation-53}}
\end{align*}
$$

From the unit vector representation $\eqref{equation-62}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \unitvec{r}\times\unitsym{z} =& \unitvec{r} \times (\unitvec{r} \cos(\theta) - \unitsym{\theta} \sin(\theta)) \\
  =& -\unitsym{\phi} \sin(\theta)
\end{align*}
$$

Applying this identity to $\eqref{equation-53}$, we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{H}} = \frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi} \left(\frac{j\beta}{r} + \frac{1}{r^2}\right) e^{-j\beta r} \sin(\phi) \unitsym{\phi}
\tag{\label{equation-43}}
\end{equation*}
$$

From $\eqref{equation-42}$, we find the electric field with $\tilde{\mathbf{J}} = \mathbf{0}$ as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}} =& \frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi} \left(\frac{j\omega\mu}{r} + \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\varepsilon'}} \frac{1}{r^2} + \frac{1}{j\omega\varepsilon' r^3} \right) e^{-j\beta r} \sin(\theta) \unitsym{\theta} \\
  &+ \frac{I\Delta z}{2\pi} \left(\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\varepsilon'}} \frac{1}{r^2} + \frac{1}{j\omega\varepsilon'} \frac{1}{r^3} \right) e^{-j\beta r} \cos(\theta) \unitvec{r}
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-44}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Factoring out $\beta = \omega\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon'}$ and $\eta = \sqrt{\mu/\varepsilon'}$, the fields $\eqref{equation-43}$ and $\eqref{equation-44}$ can be refactored as

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{H}} = \frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi} j\beta \left(1 + \frac{1}{j\beta r}\right) \frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{r} \sin(\phi) \unitsym{\phi} \tag{\label{equation-45}}
\end{equation*}
$$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}} =& \frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi} j\omega\mu \left(1 + \frac{1}{j\beta r} - \frac{1}{(\beta r)^2} \right) \frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{r} \sin(\theta) \unitsym{\theta} \\
  &+ \frac{I\Delta z}{2\pi} \eta \left(\frac{1}{r} - j\frac{1}{\beta r^2} \right) \frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{r} \cos(\theta) \unitvec{r}
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-46}}
\end{equation*}
$$

In the far-field region $r \gg \lambda$ of the dipole, corresponding to $\beta r \gg 1$, all terms with inverse powers of $\beta r$ are negligible in $\eqref{equation-45}$ and $\eqref{equation-46}$, and the fields converge asymptotically to

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{H}}^\text{ff} =& \frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi} j\beta \frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{r} \sin(\theta) \unitvec{\phi} \tag{\label{equation-47}} \\
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}}^\text{ff} =& \frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi} j\omega\mu \frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{r} \sin(\theta) \unitvec{\theta} \tag{\label{equation-48}}
\end{align*}
$$

These are called radiation fields of the ideal dipole. The ratio of the electric and magnetic far-field components is

$$
  \frac{E_\theta^\text{ff}}{H_\phi^\text{ff}} = \frac{\omega\mu}{\beta} = \frac{\omega\mu}{\omega\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon'}} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\varepsilon'}} = \eta
$$

where $\eta$ is the intrinsic impedance of the medium. The complex power density of the radiation fields $\eqref{equation-47}$ and $\eqref{equation-48}$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \mathbf{S} =& \frac{1}{2} \tilde{\mathbf{E}} \times\tilde{\mathbf{H}}^* \\
  =& \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi}\right)^2 \omega\mu\beta \frac{\sin^2 (\theta)}{r^2} \left[j e^{-j\beta r} \unitsym{\theta} \times (-j e^{j\beta r}) \unitsym{\phi}\right] \\
  =& \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi}\right)^2 \omega\mu\beta \frac{\sin^2 (\theta)}{r^2} \unitvec{r}
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-49}}
\end{equation*}
$$

The radiated power flux through a sphere of radius $r$ surrounding the ideal dipole is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  P_f =& \iint \mathbf{S} \cdot \d\mathbf{s} \\
  =& \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi}\right)^2 \omega\mu\beta \int_0^{2\pi} \d\phi \int_0^\pi \sin^3 (\theta) \;\d\theta \\
  =& \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi}\right)^2 \omega\mu\beta 2\pi \frac{4}{3} \\
  =& \frac{\omega\mu\beta}{12\pi} (I\Delta z)^2
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-50}}
\end{equation*}
$$

In the near-field region $r \ll\lambda$ of the dipole, corresponding to $\beta r \ll 1$, the terms with the largest inverse powers of $\beta r$ dominate in $\eqref{equation-45}$ and $\eqref{equation-46}$, giving

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{H}}^\text{nf} =& \frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi} \frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{r^2} \sin(\theta) \unitsym{\phi} \tag{\label{equation-51}} \\
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}}^\text{nf} =& -j\eta \frac{I\Delta z}{2\pi\beta} \frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{r^3} \left(\frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta) \unitsym{\theta} + \cos(\theta) \unitvec{r}\right) \tag{\label{equation-52}}
\end{align*}
$$

The magnetic near-field in $\eqref{equation-51}$ decays as $r^{-2}$, which is analogous to an induction field generated from a steady or slowly oscillating current. The electric near-field decays as $r^{-3}$, which is analogous to the field of an electrostatic dipole field formed by charges $q$ and $-q$ spaced $\Delta z$ apart. In the near-field, the electric field components $E_\theta^\text{nf}$ and $E_r^\text{nf}$ are in-phase, but are in phase-quadrature ($\pm \pi/4$ out of phase) with the magnetic field component $H_\phi^\text{nf}$. This phase relationship becomes explicit by evaluating the near-field Poynting vector

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \mathbf{S}^\text{nf} =& \frac{1}{2} [E_\theta^\text{nf} H_\phi^{\text{nf}*} \unitvec{r} - E_r^\text{nf} H_\phi^{\text{nf}*} \unitsym{\theta}] \\
  =& -\frac{j\eta}{2\beta} \left(\frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi} \right)^2 \frac{1}{r^5} (\sin^2 (\theta) \unitvec{r} - \sin(2\theta) \unitsym{\theta})
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-52}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Because $\mathbf{S}^\text{nf}$ is purely imaginary, the near-field region exhibits no net time-averaged radial power flow. The radiation fields, in contrast, are in-phase giving a real-valued Poynting vector that is radially directed. The imaginary power density corresponds to standing waves, rather than traveling waves associated with radiation, and indicate stored energy as in a reactive device. 

The quadrature phase relationship between between $\tilde{\mathbf{E}}^\text{nf}$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{H}}^\text{nf}$ and indicates that energy is periodically interchanged between the electric and magnetic near-fields. At instants when dipole charge distribution is maximal the electric field dominate; a quarter-period, when the current is maximal at the dipole center, the magnetic field magnetic field dominates. This oscillatory exchange reflects stored energy.

The imaginary power density in the near field is manifested by a reactive component of the antenna input impedance. The real part of the input impedance represents radiation if ohmic losses on the antenna structure can be neglected, while the imaginary part corresponds to stored energy.

The radiated power density $\eqref{equation-49}$ and the reactive power density $\eqref{equation-52}$ are both maximum for $\theta = \pi/4$. The characteristic distance at which the magnitudes of the radiated and reactive powers are equal is 

$$
  r = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi}
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

From $\eqref{equation-49}$ and $\eqref{equation-52}$ we find that the ratio of radial power densities magnitues $|S_r / S_r^\text{nf}|$ is given by

$$
  \frac{S_r}{|S_r^\text{nf}|} = \frac{\omega\mu\beta^2 r^3}{\eta}
$$

Since $\eta = \sqrt{\mu/\epsilon}$ and $\beta = \omega\sqrt{\mu\epsilon}$ we find that

$$
\begin{align*}
  \frac{S_r}{S_r^\text{nf}} =& \omega\mu\beta^2 r^3 \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mu}} \\
  =& \underbrace{\omega\sqrt{\mu\epsilon}}_{\beta} \beta^2 r^3 \\
  =& (\beta r)^3
\end{align*}
$$

The radial power density magnitues are equal when $|S_r / S_r^\text{nf}| = (\beta r)^3 = 1$ or $r = 1/\beta$. Since $\beta = 2\pi/\lambda$, it follows that

$$
  r = \frac{1}{\beta} = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi}
$$
</details>

The region inside this radius, reactive power dominates, is known as the radiansphere. At large distances $r \gg \lambda/2\pi$, called the far-field region, radiated power dominates. In the far-field region, the angular field distribution (radiation pattern) is independent of distance from the dipole.

From the fields $\eqref{equation-45}$ and $\eqref{equation-46}$, the wave impedance $Z(r) = E_\theta / E_\phi$ for the ideal dipole is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
  Z(r) =& \frac{\omega\mu}{\beta} \frac{1 + \frac{1}{j\beta r} - \frac{1}{(\beta r)^2}}{1 + \frac{1}{j\beta r}} \\
  =& \eta \left(1 - \frac{\frac{1}{(\beta r)^2}}{1 + \frac{1}{j\beta r}} \right) \\
  =& \eta \left(1 + \frac{1}{j\beta r(j\beta r + 1)}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

In the far-field region $\beta r \gg 1$ the fraction term in the parenthesis converges to

$$
  \lim_{x\to\infty} \left|\frac{1}{jx(jx + 1)}\right| \leq \frac{1}{(x)^2} = 0,\; x = \beta r
$$

so that $Z(r) \to \eta$ when $\beta r \gg 1$.

The magnitude error of $E_\theta$ relative to the far-field value $E_\theta^\text{ff}$ is given by

$$
  \epsilon_{E_\theta} = \frac{|E_\theta| - |E_\theta^\text{ff}|}{|E_\theta^\text{ff}|}
$$

Noting that

$$
  |E_\theta| = |E_\theta^\text{ff}| \cdot \left|1 + \frac{1}{j\beta r} - \frac{1}{(\beta r)^2} \right|
$$

we find

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \epsilon_{E_\theta} =& \left|1 + \frac{1}{j\beta r} - \frac{1}{(\beta r)^2} \right| - 1 \\
  =& \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(\beta r)^2} + \frac{1}{(\beta r)^4}}
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-70}}
\end{equation*}
$$

  =& \sqrt{\left(1 - \frac{1}{x^2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2} \\

### Radiation patterns

A radiation pattern is a graphical representation of the far-field radiation characteristics of an antenna. A general property for all antennas is that their radiated fields decay with distance as spherical waves. The angular variation of these fields, however, depends on the antenna's geometry, size and construction.

Radiation patterns are determined either by calculation or direct measurement of the fields radiated by the antenna. A pattern taken in a plane containing the electric field vector is called an *E-plane pattern*, while a pattern taken in the plane orthogonal to the E-plane, which contains the magnetic field, is called an *H-plane pattern*. For linearly polarized antennas, these two are collectively referred to as principal plane patterns. Patterns that are uniform in one plane, e.g. independent of the azimuthal angle, are called *omnidirectional patterns*.

#### Radiation from line currents

Consider a filament of current along the $z$-axis and located near the origin, known as a line source. The current distribution is given by

$$
  \tilde{\mathbf{J}} (\mathbf{r}') = I(z') \delta(x') \delta(y') \unitvec{z}
$$

Substituting this into $\eqref{equation-40}$ results in a one-dimensional integral for the vector potential

$$
\begin{equation*}
  A_z = \mu \int I(z') \frac{e^{-j\beta R}}{4\pi R} \;\d z'
\tag{\label{equation-54}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Due to rotational symmetry of the source about the $z$-axis, the radiation fields are independent of $\phi$. We therefore restrict attention to the $yz$-plan corresponding to $\phi = \pi/4$ for clarity. In spherical coordinates, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  r^2 =& y^2 + z^2 \tag{\label{equation-55}} \\
  z =& r\cos(\theta) \tag{\label{equation-56}} \\
  y =& r\sin(\theta) \tag{\label{equation-57}}
\end{align*}
$$

Since $\mathbf{r} = y\unitvec{y} + z\unitvec{z}$ and $\mathbf{r}' = z' \unitvec{z}$, we have $\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}' = y\unitvec{y} + (z - z')\unitvec{z}$, and then

$$
\begin{align*}
  R =& \sqrt{y^2 + (z - z')^2} \\
  =& \sqrt{y^2 + z^2 - 2zz' + (z')^2}
\end{align*}
$$

Substituting $\eqref{equation-55}$ and $\eqref{equation-56}$, by switching to spherical coordinates, we get

$$
  R = \sqrt{r^2 + [-2r \cos(\theta) z' + (z')^2]}
$$

Applying binomial expansion, we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
  R =& \sum_{k=0}^\infty \binom{1/2}{k} (r^2)^{1/2 - k} [-2r \cos(\theta) z' + (z')^2]^k \\
  =& r - z' \cos(\theta) + \frac{(z')^2 \sin^2 (\theta)}{2r} + \frac{(z')^3 \sin^2 (\theta) \cos(\theta)}{2r^2} + \dots \tag{\label{equation-58}}
\end{align*}
$$

In the far-field region, $r \gg |z'|$, we make the following approximation in $\eqref{equation-54}$
- **Amplitude factor:** Since variations of $R$ relative to $r$ are small small we approximate $R^{-1} \approx r^{-1}$.
- **Phase factor:** Since $e^{-j\beta R}$ is oscillatory, small path length variations $\Delta R \sim z' \cos(\theta)$ can produce significant phase shifts of order $\beta z' \cos(\theta)$. Thus, the first-order variation in $R$ must be retained, i.e $R \approx r - z' \cos(\theta)$. 

With these far field approximations, $\eqref{equation-54}$ reduces to

$$
\begin{align*}
  A_z =& \mu \in I(z') \frac{e^{-j\beta(r - z' \cos\theta)}}{4\pi r} \;\d z' \\
  =& \mu \frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{4\pi r} \underbrace{\int I(z') e^{j\beta z' \cos \theta} \;\d z'}_{: F(\theta)}
\end{align*}
$$

The integral $F(\theta)$ describes a Fourier transform of the current distribution $I(z')$, and is called the radiation integral or diffraction integral. From $\eqref{equation-32}$ the magnetic field is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{H} =& \frac{1}{\mu} \nabla\times\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{\mu} \nabla\times (A_z \unitvec{z}) \\
  =& \frac{1}{\mu} \nabla\times (-A_z \sin(\theta) \unitsym(\theta) + A_z \cos(\theta) \unitvec{r})
\end{align*}
$$

where $\eqref{equation-62}$ was used. Taking the curl of $A_z$, depending on $r$ and $\theta$, in spherical coordinates using $\eqref{equation-61}$, leads to

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{H} = \unitsym{\phi} \frac{1}{\mu r} \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial r} (-rA_z \sin(\theta)) - \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} (A_z \cos(\theta)) \right]
\tag{\label{equation-68}}
\end{equation*}
$$

The radial derivative evaluates to

$$
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (-rA_z \sin(\theta)) =& \mu \frac{-\sin(\theta)}{4\pi} F(\theta) \frac{\partial}{\partial r} e^{-j\beta r} \\
  =& j\beta r \sin(\theta) \mu \frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{4\pi r} F(\theta) \\
  =& j\beta r \sin(\theta) A_z
\end{align*}
$$

and the angular derivative can be refactored as

$$
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} (A_z \cos(\theta)) =& \cos(\theta) \frac{\partial A_z}{\partial\theta} - A_z \sin(\theta) \\
  =& \mu\frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{4\pi r} \cos(\theta) \frac{\d F(\theta)}{\d \theta} - A_z \sin(\theta)
\end{align*}
$$

Inserting the partial derivatives into $\eqref{equation-68}$ leads to

$$
  \mathbf{H} = \unitsym{\phi} \frac{1}{\mu} \left[j\beta \sin(\theta) A_z + \frac{\sin(\theta)}{r} A_z - \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\mu} \frac{\mu \cos(\theta) e^{-j\beta r}}{4\pi r^2} \frac{\d F(\theta)}{\d\theta} \right]
$$

In the far-field region, i.e. $\beta r \gg 1$, the $r^{-1}$ and $r^{-2}$ terms become negligible, so that in leading-order the magnetic field is

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{H} = \frac{j\beta}{\mu} \sin(\theta) A_z \unitsym{\phi}
\tag{\label{equation-65}}
\end{equation*}
$$

The electric field is obtained from $\eqref{equation-64}$. Using $\eqref{equation-54}$ in $\eqref{equation-55}$ and retaining only the $r^{-1}$ term under the assumption $\beta r \gg 1$, yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{E}= -j\omega A_\theta \unitsym(\theta) = j\omega \sin(\theta) A_z \unitsym{\theta}
\tag{\label{equation-66}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that this result is the portion of the first term of $\eqref{equation-64}$ that is transverse to $\unitvec{r}$ because $-j\omega \mathbf{A} = -j\omega(-A_z \sin(\theta) \unitsym{\theta} + A_z \cos(\theta) \unitvec{r})$. This property holds in general and is not restricted to line sources.

The ratio of the radiation field components in $\eqref{equation-65}$ and $\eqref{equation-66}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
  E_\theta = \frac{\omega\mu}{\beta} H_\phi = \frac{\omega\mu}{\omega\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon'}} H_\phi = \eta H_\phi
\tag{\label{equation-67}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\eta = \sqrt{\mu/\varepsilon'}$ is the intrinsic impedance of the medium. Thus, the radiation fields are orthogonal to each other and to the direction of propagation $\unitvec{r}$ and their magnitudes are related by $\eqref{equation-67}$. These are the familiar properties of plane waves. They also hold for the general form of a *transverse electromagnetic (TEM) wave* that has both the electric and magnetic fields transverse to the direction of propagation. In general, radiation from a finite antenna is a special case of a TEM wave, called a "spherical wave", that propagates radially outward from the antenna and the radiation fields have no radial components. Spherical wave behaviour is also characterized by the $e^{-j\beta r}{4\pi r}$ factor in the field expressions. The $e^{-j\beta r}$ phase factor indicates a traveling wave propagating radially outward from the origin and the $r^{-1}$ decay leads to constant power flow just as with the ideal dipole. Generally, the radiation fields of all antennas of finite extent display this dependence with distance from the antenna.

Although the radiated wavefront is spherical, at sufficiently large distances the local curvature is negligible, so the fields appear locally as plane waves. This is the sense in which far-field radiation may be regarded as plane-wave-like.

<MathBox title="Uniform line source" boxType="example">
A uniform line source has a constant current $I_0$ along its extent. The current of a $z$-directed uniform line source  centered at the origin is

$$
  I(z') = \begin{cases}
    I_0,\quad& x' = 0,\; y' = 0, |z'| \leq \frac{L}{2} \\
    0,\quad& \text{elsewhere}
  \end{cases}
$$

where $L$ is the length of the line source. The vector potential is

$$
\begin{align*}
  A_z =& \mu \frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{4\pi r} \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} I_0 e^{j\beta z' \cos(\theta)} \;\d z' \\
  =& \mu \frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{4\pi r} \int_0 \left(\frac{e^{j\beta (L/2)\cos(\theta)} - e^{-j\beta (L/2) \cos(\theta)}}{j\beta\cos(\theta)} \right) \\
  =& \mu \frac{I_0 L e^{-j\beta r}}{4\pi r} \frac{\sin[(\beta L/2) \cos(\theta)]}{(\beta L/2) \cos(\theta)}
\end{align*}
$$

and the electric field is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \mathbf{E} =& j\omega \sin(\theta) A_z \unitsym{\theta} \\
  =& \frac{j\omega\mu I_0 L e^{-j\beta r}}{4\pi r} \sin(\theta) \frac{\sin[(\beta L/2) \cos(\theta)]}{(\beta L/2) \cos(\theta)} \unitsym{\theta}
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-88}}
\end{equation*}
$$
</MathBox>

#### Far-field coditions and field regions

For general sources the far-field approximation relies on the parallel-ray assumption, which expresses the distance between and observation point and a source point as

$$
\begin{align*}
  R =& r - r' \cos(\alpha) \\
  =& r - r' \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r}'}{rr'} \\
  =& r - \unitvec{r} \cdot \mathbf{r}''
\end{align*}
$$

The far-field distance (Rayleigh distance), $r_\text{ff}$, is defined as the radial distance at which the phase error introduced by neglecting the quadratic term in $\eqref{equation-58}$ is small. This is typically taken as $\pi/8$ radians which corresponds to sixteenth of a wavelength

$$
  \frac{2\pi}{/\lambda}\frac{\lambda}{16} = \frac{\pi}{8}
$$

The far-field region is $r \geq r_\text{ff}$.

For a line source of length $D$, the maximum value of the quadratic term in $\eqref{equation-68}$ occurs for $z' = D/2$ and $\theta = \pi/2$. The far-field distance $r_\text{ff}$ is found by equating the maximum quadratic contribution to a sixteenth of a wavelength, or $(D/2)^2 /2r_\text{ff} = \lambda/16$. Solving for $r_\text{ff}$ gives

$$
  r_\text{ff} = \frac{2D^2}{\lambda}
$$

This far-field condition is not sufficiently large when the antenna is electrically small, for which its physical size is small compared to the wavelength.

The region interior to the far field, called the near field, is divided into the reactive near field where the reactive fields dominate over the radiation (real-valued) fields and the radiating near field where the radiation fields dominate over the reactive fields.

For the ideal dipole, the radiated-reactive power density ratio is $|S_r^\text{ff} / S_r^\text{nf}| = (\beta r)^3$. The magnitudes of the radiated and reactive power densities are equal when $\beta r = 1$ or $r = \lambda/2\pi$, which is the radius of the radiansphere. For tue boundary value $\beta r = 10$, the radiated power density is $1000$ times ($30 \text{dB}$) greather than the reactive power density. Thus $r = 10/\beta = 1.6\lambda$, forms the far-field boundary for the ideal dipole, and corresponds to the point where the wave impedance converges to the intrinsic impedance of free space $\eta = \sqrt{\mu/\epsilon}$. A more conservative condition or $r = 5\lambda$ aries based on the error in magnitude of the $E_\theta$ in $\eqref{equation-70}$ being $30 \text{dB}$. These results also apply to any electrically small antenna, which is defined as fitting inside a sphere of radius $a$ equal to or less that $\lambda/2\pi$.

For a line source, the reactive-radiating near field boundary is $r = 0.62 \sqrt{D^3/\lambda}$ and the far-field starts at $2D^2 / \lambda$. An additional far-field distance condition is that $r$ is greater than $5D$, which is based on the maximum error in distance to the far field being $10%$.

The radiated fields (i.e., in the far field) are found by summing up all contributions due to tiny subdivisions of the current distributions (i.e., integrating). The resulting radiation pattern is independent of distance from the antenna, $r$, and varies only with angle around the antenna. This result is a consequence of approximating rays from parts of the source as being parallel. Then distance in the far field is irrelevant and only angles matter. A further general principle for all antennas is that in the far field the only field components present are transverse to the radial direction

#### Normalized field and power patterns

The radiation pattern of an antenna describes the variation of the radiated electric field as a function of direction on a spherical surface centered at the antenna. Since the radial distance $r$ is held constant in this description, the field pattern depends only on the angular coordinates $(\theta, \phi)$.

It is convenient to normalize the field pattern so that its maximum magnitude is unity. For a $z$-directed source that produces only a $\theta$-polarized electric field component $E_\theta$ the normalized field pattern is defined as

$$
  F(\theta, \phi) := \frac{E_\theta (\theta)}{\max_{\theta, \phi} |E_\theta (\theta, \phi)|}
$$

where $\max_{\theta, \phi} (E_\theta)$ is the maximum magnitude of $E_\theta$ over the observation sphere of radius $r$. In this case, the pattern is relative to linear polarization in the $\theta$-orientation.

In general, $E_\theta$ can be complex-valued. Since only the relative phase is of interest in pattern analysis, the phase at the normalization point is usually set to zero.

In general, a normalized field pattern can be written as the product

$$
  F(\theta, \phi) = g(\theta, \phi) f(\theta, \phi)
$$

where 
- $g(\theta, \phi)$ is the element factor, i.e. the field pattern of a single infinitesimal source element
- $f(\theta, \phi)$ is the pattern factor, determined by the spatial distribution of the source elements. 

For a $z$-directed infinitesimal current element is

$$
  g(\theta) = \sin(\theta)
$$

which represents the projection of the current element into the observation direction. The $\sin(\theta)$ dependence captures the fact that no radiation is observed along the axis of the element.

The pattern factor $f(\theta, \phi)$ represents the integrated effect of ration contributions from the current distribution, which can be treated as being made up of many current elements. The pattern value in a specific diresction is the found by summing the parallel rays from each from each current element to the far field with the magnitude and phase of each included. The radiation integral $\eqref{equation-}$ sums the far-field contributions from the current elements and when normalized yields the pattern factor.

The radiation integral encodes both magnitude variations (due to current amplitude) and phase variations (due to current phase and path-length differences). Interference of these contributions produces lobes in the radiation pattern.

The main lobe corresponds to the direction of maximum radiation intensity. This occurs when the contributions from the current distribution arrive most nearly in-phase at the far-field point. For a uniformly phased source, this typically corresponds to the direction normal to the antenna aperture.

Frequently, the radiation pattern is expressed in terms of power density rather than field amplitude. The general normalized power pattern is defined as

$$
  P(\theta, \phi) := |F(\theta, \phi)|^2
$$

This corresponds to the angular variation of the radial component of the time-averaged Poynting vector, normalized to its maximum value.

Radiation patterns are commonly expressed in decibels. The field and power patterns are the same in decibels, i.e.

$$
  P(\theta, \phi)_\text{dB} = |F(\theta,\phi)|_\text{dB}
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

In decibels, the field pattern is given by

$$
  |F(\theta, \phi)|_\text{dB} = 20 \log_{10} |F(\theta, \phi)|
$$

and the power pattern and is

$$
\begin{align*}
  P(\theta, \phi)_\text{dB} =& 10 \log_{10} P(\theta, \phi) \\
  =& 10 \log_{10} |F(\theta, \phi)|^2 \\
  =& 20 \log_{20} |F(\theta, \phi)|^2
\end{align*}
$$

This shows that

$$
  P(\theta, \phi)_\text{dB} = |F(\theta,\phi)|_\text{dB}
$$

<MathBox title="Normalized power pattern for an ideal dipole" boxType="example">
From $\eqref{equation-48}$, the normal field pattern of an ideal dipole is

#### Radiation pattern parameters

The main beam (or main lobe or major lobe) is the lobe containing the direction of maximum radiation. There is also usually a series of lobes smaller than the main lobe. Any lobe other than the main lobe is called a minor lobe. Minor lobes are composed of side lobes and back lobes. Back lobes are directly opposite the main lobe, or sometimes they are taken to be the lobes in the half-space opposite the main lobe. The term side lobe is sometimes reserved for those minor lobes near the main lobe, but is most often taken to be synonymous with minor lobe; we will use the latter convention.

A measure of how well the power is concentrated into the main lobe is the (relative) side lobe level, which is the ratio of the pattern value of a side lobe peak to the pattern value of the main lobe. The largest side lobe level for the whole pattern is the maximum (relative) side lobe level, frequently abbreviated as SLL. In decibels, it is given by

$$
  \operatorname{SLL}_\text{dB} = 20 \log_{10} \frac{|F(\operatorname{SLL})}{F(\max)}
$$

where $|F(\max)|$ is the maximum value of the pattern magnitude and $|F(\operatorname{SLL})|$ is the pattern value of the maximum of the highest side lobe magnitude.

The width of the main beam is quantified through half-power beamwidth (HP), which is the angular separation of the points where the main beam of the power pattern equals one half of the maximum value

$$
  \operatorname{HP} = |\theta_\text{HP left} - \theta_\text{HP right}|
$$

where $\theta_\text{HP left}$ and $\theta_\text{HP right}$ are points to the left and right of the main beam maximum for which the normalized power pattern has a value of one-half. On the field pattern $|F(\theta)|$, these points correspond to the value $1/\sqrt{2}$. In three dimensions, the radiation pattern major lobe becomes a solid object and the half-power contour is a continuous curve. If this curve is essentially elliptical, the pattern cuts that contain the major and minor axes of the ellipse determine what the IEEE defines as the principal half-power beamwidths.

Antennas are often referred to by the type of pattern they produce. An isotropic antenna, which is hypothetical, radiates equally in all directions giving a constant radiation pattern. An omnidirectional antenna produces a pattern that is constant in
one plane.

We often refer to a directive antenna as being broadside or endfire. A broadside antenna is one for which the main beam maximum is in a direction normal to the plane containing the antenna. An endfire antenna is one for which the main beam is in the plane containing the antenna. A type of broadside pattern is a fan beam, and a type of endfire pattern is a pencil beam.

### Directivity and gain

The directivity of an antenna describes how much it concentrates energy in one direction in preference to radiation in other directions. If the antenna is $100%$ efficient, the directivity is equal to the gain of the antenna.

From $\eqref{equation-71}$ the power radiated by an antenne is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  P =& \iint \mathbf{S} \cdot \d\mathbf{s} = \frac{1}{2} \Re \iint (\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}^*) \cdot \d\mathbf{s} \\
  =& \frac{1}{2} \Re \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi (E_\theta H_\phi^* - E_\theta H_\phi^*) r^2 \sin(\theta) \;\d\theta \d\phi
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-72}}
\end{equation*}
$$

From the plane wave relation $\mathbf{H} = \frac{1}{\eta} \unitvec{r} \times \mathbf{E}$ it follows that

$$
  H_\phi = \frac{E_\theta}{\eta},\quad H_\theta = -\frac{E_\phi}{\eta}
$$

Inserting these into $\eqref{equation-72}$ yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
  P = \frac{1}{2\eta} \iint (|E_\theta|^2 + |E_\phi|^2) r^2 \;\d\Omega
\tag{\label{equation-73}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\d\Omega = \sin(\theta) \;\d\theta \d\phi$ is an infinitesimal angle element. The integral can be evaluated over any surface enclosing the antenna, but for simplicity a spherical surface centered on the origin is usually used. Since the magnitude variations of the radiation fields are $1/r$, it is convenient to introduce radiation intensity, defined as


$$
\begin{equation*}
  U(\theta,\phi) = \frac{1}{2} \Re(\mathbf{E} \times\mathbf{H}^*) \cdot r^2 \unitvec{r} = S(\theta, \phi) r^2
\tag{\label{equation-74}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Radiation intensity is the power radiated in a given direction per unit solid angle and has units of watts per square radian, also called steradian (sr). Radiation intensity can be expressed as

$$
  U(\theta, \phi) = U_m |F(\theta, \phi)|^2
$$

where $U_m = U(\theta_\text{max}, \phi_\text{max})$ is the maximum radiation intensity and $|F(\theta, \phi)|^2$ is the power pattern normalized to a maximum value of unity in the direction $(\theta_\text{max}, \phi_\text{max})$. The total power radiated is obtained by integrating the radiation intensity over all angles around the antenna

$$
\begin{align*}
  P =& \iint U(\theta, \phi) \;\d\Omega \\
  =& U_m \iint |F(\theta, \phi)|^2 \;\d\Omega \tag{\label{equation-76}}
\end{align*}
$$

In particular for a hypothetical isotropic source with constant intensity $\bar{U}$, the total power is

$$
  P = \bar{U} \iint \;\d\Omega = 4\pi \bar{U}
$$

For nonisotropic sources, the radiation intensity is not constant throughout space, but an average power per steradian can be defined as

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \bar{U} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \iint U(\theta, \phi) \;\d\Omega = \frac{P}{4\pi}
\tag{\label{equation-79}}
\end{equation*}
$$

The average radiation intensity $\bar{U}$ equals the radiation intensity $U(\theta,\phi)$ that an isotropic source with the same input power $P$ would radiate.

<MathBox title="Radiation intensity of an ideal dipole" boxType="example">
Using $eqref{equation-74}$ with $\eqref{equation-47}$ and $\eqref{equation-48}$ we find

$$
  U(\theta, \phi) = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi} \right)^2 \beta\omga\mu \sin^2 (\theta)
$$

so that

$$
  U_m = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi} \right)^2 \beta\omga\mu 
$$

From $\eqref{equation-50}$, the average radiation intensity of an ideal dipole is

$$
\begin{align*}
  \bar{U} =& \frac{P}{4\pi} = \frac{(\beta\omega\mu/ 12\pi) (I\Delta z)^2}{4\pi} \\
  =& \frac{1}{3} \left(\frac{I\Delta z}{4\pi} \right)^2 \beta\omega\mu \\
  =& \frac{2}{3} U_m \tag{\label{equation-89}}
\end{align*}
$$
</MathBox>

#### Directivitity

Directivity is defined as the ratio of the radiation intensity in a certain direction to the average radiation intensity. The reference direction is usually taken to be that of the maximum radiation, giving

$$
\begin{equation*}
  D = \frac{U_m}{\bar{U}} = \frac{U_m}{P/4\pi}
\tag{\label{equation-75}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Unless otherwise stated, directivity will be assime to be this maximum directivity value. If both the numerator and denominator are divided by $\eqref{equation-75}$ becomes a ratio of power densities at distance $r$ from the antenna

$$
\begin{align*}
  D =& \frac{U/r^2}{\bar{U}/r^2} \\
  =& \frac{\frac{1}{2} \max[\Re(\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}^*) \cdot\unitvec{r}]}{P/4\pi r^2}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, directivity has two interpretations, as a ratio of maximum to average radiation intensities and as a ratio of maximum to average power densities. Directivity can be tied more directly to the pattern function. First, we define the beam solid angle

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \Omega_A = \iint |F(\theta, \phi)|^2 \;\d\Omega
\tag{\label{equation-77}}
\end{equation*}
$$

The beam solid angle of the actual radiation pattern has the same solid angle as constant radiation of a level equal to the maximum value radiation intensity over all the beam area, or

$$
  P = U_m \Omega_A
$$

This also follows from $\eqref{equation-76}$ and $\eqref{equation-77}$. Substituting $\eqref{equation-}$ in $\eqref{equation-75}$ with $\eqref{equation-77}$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
  D = \frac{4\pi}{\Omega_A}
\tag{\label{equation-78}}
\end{equation*}
$$

These results show that directivity is entirely determined by the pattern shape; it is independent of the details of the antenna hardware. Directivity as a function of pattern angle is expressed simply as the directitiy multiplied by the power pattern

$$
  D(\theta,\phi) = D|F(\theta,\phi)|^2
$$

In the case of isotropic power distribution, the radiation intensity would have a maximum value equal to its average value, that is $U_m = \bar{U}$ or $\Omega_A = 4\pi$. Thus, the directivity of this isotropic pattern is unity. The distribution of radiation intensity $U(\theta, \phi)$ for an actual antenne has a maximum radiation density in the direction $(\theta_\text{max}, \phi_\text{max})$ of $U_m = D\bar{U}$ and an average radiation intensity of $\bar{U} = P/4\pi$. There is $D$ times as much power density in the direction $(\theta_\text{max}, \phi_\text{max})$ as there would be if the same total power were radiated by an isotropic source. Thus, by directing the radiated power $P$ in a preferred direction (by the maximum radiation direction) the radiation intensity is increased in that direction by a factor of $D$ over what it would be if the same radiated power had been isotropically radiated.

<MathBox title="Directivity of an ideal dipole" boxType="example">
The directivity if an ideal dipole is easily found using $\eqref{equation-75}$ with $eqref{equation-89}$

$$
  D = \frac{U_m}{\bar{U}} = \frac{U_m}{\frac{3}{2} U_m} = \frac{3}{2}
$$

The directivity can also be calculated directly by finding the beam solid angle

$$
\begin{align*}
  \Omega_A =& \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi |\sin(\theta)|^2 \sin(\theta) \;\d\theta \;\d\phi \\
  =&\frac{8\pi}{3} 
\end{align*}
$$

From $\eqref{equation-78}$, we find

$$
  D = \frac{4\pi}{\Omega_A} = \frac{4\pi}{8\pi /3} = \frac{3}{2}
$$
</MathBox>

#### Gain

When an antenna is used in a system (say as a transmitting antenna) we are interested in how efficiently the antenna transforms available power at its input terminals into radiated power, as well as its directive properties. To quantify this, gain is defined as $4\pi$ times the ratio of the maximum radiation intensity to the net power accepted by the antenna from the connected transmitter, or

$$
\begin{equation*}
  G = \frac{4\pi U_m}{P_m}
\tag{\label{equation-80}}
\end{equation*}
$$

This is a power quantity and is sometimes referred to as power gain. This definition does not include losses due to mismatches of impedance or polarization.

Gain can be expressed as a function of angle by including the power pattern as $G(\theta, \phi) = G|F(\theta, \phi)|^2$. Gain can also be give as a value in a specific direction. If no direction is specified and the gain value is not given as a function of $\theta$ and $\phi$, it is assumed to be the maximum gain.

Comparing the gain formula $\eqref{equation-80}$ with the directivity formula $\eqref{equation-75}$, the only difference is the power value used. Directivity can be interpreted as the gain an antenna would have if all input power appeared as radiated power. Gin includes the fact that real antennas do not behave in this fashion and some of teh input power is lost on the antenna. The portion of input power $P_\text{in}$ that does no appear as radiated power is absorbed on the antenna and nearby structures. The radiation efficiency, $e_r$, of an antenna is defined as

$$
\begin{equation*}
  e_r = \frac{P}{P_\text{in}} \in [0,1]
\tag{\label{equation-87}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Many antennas are highly efficient, with radiation efficiency close to $1$. However, electrically small antenna are very inefficient. Substituting $P = e_r P_\text{in}$ in $\eqref{equation-75}$ we obtain

$$
  G = e_r D
$$

Thus, the gain of an antenna is equal to its purely directional characteristic of directivity multiplied by radiation efficiency. The term absolute gain, which is synonymous with gain, is sometimes used.

#### Units

Because gain is a power ratio it can be calculated in decibels as follows

$$
  G_\text{dB} = 10 \log_{10} G
$$

Similar for directivity

$$
  D_\text{dB} = 10 \log_{10} G
$$

Frequently gain is used to describe the performance of the antenna relative to some standard reference antenna. This relative gain is defined as the ratio of the maximum radiation intensity from the antenna $U_m$ to the maximum radiation intensity from a reference antenna $U_{m, \text{ref}}$ with the same input power

$$
\begin{equation*}
  G_\text{ref} = \frac{U_m}{U_{m, \text{ref}}}
\tag{\label{equation-81}}
\end{equation*}
$$

This is a convenient definition from a measurement standpoint. The formal definition of gain employs a lossless isotropic antenna as a reference antenna. This can be shown that noting that the lossless isotropic reference antenna has a maximum radiation density of $P_\text{in} / 4\pi$ because all of its input power is radiated, and substituting this into $\eqref{equation-81}$ for $U_{m,\text{ref}}$ leads to $\eqref{equation-80}$.

It is common at frequencies below $1 \text{ GHz}$ to quote gain values relative to that of a half-wave dipole because a half-wave dipole is the usual reference antenna used in gain measurements at these frequencies. Gain relative to a half-wave dipole carries the units of $\text{dBd}$ and is related to gain relative to the normal implied reference of a lossless, isotropic antenna as

$$
  G_\text{dBd} = G_\text{dB} - 2.15
$$

The unit of gain is sometimes denoted as $\text{dBi}$ instead of just $\text{dB}$ to emphasize that an isotropic antenna is used as the reference.

### Antenna impedance

The primary function of a transmitting antenna is to convert a bound wave to an unbound (i.e. radiated) wave, and vice versa for a receiving antenna. Whereas the transmission line connected to an antenna binds the wave and prevents it from radiating, the antenna itself should enable radio waves to leave the structure. The antenna is an interface between wave phenomena on and beyond the antenna to the connecting circuit hardwatr. The antenna input terminals from the interface point and the circui parameter of impedance is used to characterize the input to the antenna. The *input impedance* of an antenna (or simply *antenna impedance*) will be affected by other antennas or objects that are nearby, but the discussion here assumes an isolated antenna.

As with conventional circuits, antenna impedance is composed of real and imaginary parts

$$
\begin{equation*}
  Z_A = R_A + jX_A
\tag{\label{equation-82}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Due to reciprocity, the impedance of an antenna is indentical for receiving and transmitting operation. The input resistance $R_A$ represents dissipation which occurs in two ways. Power that leaves the antenna and never return is one part of the dissipation. There are also ohmic losses just as in a lumped resistor. Electrically small antennas can have significant ohmic losses but other antennas usually have ohmic losses that are small compared to their radiation dissipation. The input reactance, $X_A$, represents power stored in the near fields of the antenna.

The averave power dissipated in an antenna is

$$
  P_\text{in} = \frac{1}{2} R_A |I_A|^2
$$

where $I_A$ is the current at the input terminals. Note that a factor of $1/2$ is present because current $I_A$ is the peak value in time waveform. Separating the dissipated power into radiative and ohmic losses gives

$$
\begin{align*}
  P_\text{in} =& P + P_o \\
  \frac{1}{2} R_A |I_A|^2 =& \frac{1}{2} R_r |I_A|^2 + \frac{1}{2} R_o |I_A|^2 \tag{\label{equation-83}}
$$

where we define the radiation resistance of an antenna referred to the input terminal as

$$
\begin{equation*}
  R_r = \frac{2P}{|I_A|^2}
\tag{\label{equation-85}}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows from $\eqref{equation-83}$ that

$$
  R_A = R_r + R_o
$$

where $R_o$ is the resistance associated with ohmic losses that inlude the directly drive part of the antenna as well as losses in other portions of the antenna structure such as a ground plan. Ohmic resistance of an antenna is defined as

$$
  R_o = \frac{2P_o}{|I_A|^2} = \frac{2(P_\text{in} - P)}{|I_A|^2}
$$

The radiated power is found using $\eqref{equation-84}$

$$
  P = \frac{1}{2} \iint (\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}^*) \cdot \d\mathbf{s}
$$

$P$ is real-valued because the power density $\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}^*$ is real-valued in the far-field.

Radiation resistance can be defined relative to the current at any point on the antenna, but we reserve $R_r$ for radiation resistance referred to the input terminals. Radiation resistance relative to the maximum current $I_m$ that occurs on the antenna $R_{rm}$ is obtained by using $I_m$ in place of $I_A$ in $\eqref{equation-85}$.

<MathBox title="Impedance of an ideal dipole" boxType="example">
Using $\eqref{equation-50}$, the radiation resistance of an ideal dipole of length $\Delta z \ll \lambda$ and input current $I_A = I$ is

$$
\begin{align*}
  R_r =& \frac{2P}{|I_A|^2} = \frac{2}{I^2}{\omega\mu\beta}{12\pi}(I\Delta z)^2 \\
  =& \frac{\sqrt{\mu\omega}\sqrt{\mu}\sqt{\varepsilon}}{\sqrt{\varepsilon}6\pi} \beta (\Delta z)^2 \\
  =& \eta \frac{\beta^2}{6\pi} (\Delta z)^2 = \eta\frac{2}{3} \pi \left(\frac{\Delta z}{\lambda}\right)^2
\end{align*}
$$

Except for low frequencies, the skin depth $\delta = \sqrt{2/\omega\mu\sigma}$ is much smaller than the conductor radius, such that the ohmic resistance for an antenna of length $L$ that carries an axially uniform current is directly proportional to the wirte length and inversely proportional to the wire circumference

$$
  R_o \approx \frac{L}{2\pi a} R_s
$$

where $a$ is the wire radius and $R_s$ is the surface resistance given by

$$
  R_s = \sqrt{\frac{\omega\mu}{2\sigma}}
$$
</MathBox>

### Radiation efficiency

In general, an efficiency factor is the ratio of wanted power to total power supplied. The radiation efficiency $e_r$ of an antenna, defined in $\eqref{equation-87}$ is the ratio of radiated power to the net power accepted by the antenna

$$
\begin{equation*}
  e_r = \frac{P}{P_\text{in}} = \frac{P}{P + P_o}
\tag{\label{equation-86}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
- $P$ is radiated power
- $P_o$ is power dissipated in ohmic losses on the antenna
- $P_\text{in} = P + P_o$ is input power accepted by the antenna

We can derive an expression for the radiation efficiency of an antenna totally in terms of resistances by substituting $\eqref{equation-83}$ and $\eqref{equation-84}$ into $\eqref{equation-86}$

$$
\begin{align*}
  e_r =& \frac{\frac{1}{2} R_r |I_A|^2}{\frac{1}{2} R_r |I_A|^2 + \frac{1}{2}R_o |I_A|^2} \\
  =& \frac{R_r}{R_r + R_o} = \frac{R_r}{R_A}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the radiation resistance relative to the total input resistance gives the radiation efficiency (often referred to just as efficiency). This fundamental equation contains the obvious result that for a fixed radiation resistance as the ohmic resistance increases, the efficiency decreases. For many antennas radiation efficiency is nearly $100%$, but electrically small antennas often have very low radiation efficiency. Low radiation efficiency is acceptable for receiving and for low-power transmitting applications. However, radiation efficiency must be as close to $100%$ as possible in high-power transmitting antennas for two reasons: the ohmic losses cost money in power consumption and the heat generated can possibly damage or destroy the antenna.

In addition to reduction in radiation efficiency, antenna ohmic losses have another undesirable effect. As with any resistive element in an electrical system, ohmic losses on antennas are noise sources. For receiving applications above $1 \text{MHz}$ when the signal is low, internal noise can swamp out a signal. Receiving antennas also pick up external noise. For frequencies around $1 \text{MHz}$ and below, external noise, mainly due to lightning, is significant and always present. This external noise picked up by the antenna via the radiation resistance is usually larger than the internal noise and antenna loss can be tolerated.

### Antenna polarization

A finite-sized source radiates a spherical wavefront. However, over a small observation region the wavefront becomes nearly planar. Such an approximation leads to the notion of a plane wave, whose electric and magnetic fields lie in a plane transverse to the propagation direction. 

The polarization of a plane wave is the trajectory traced by the instantaneous electric field at a fixed spatial point as a function of time. For a completely polarized wave, this trajectory is an ellipse. In contrast, unpolarized or partially polarized waves (e.g., due to random noise processes) do not yield deterministic elliptical trajectories. The temporal and spatial variations of the magnetic field are analogous to those of the electric field, except that the magnetic field is orthogonal both to the electric field and to the propagation direction, ensuring transversality.

The polarization ellipse admits several important limiting cases:
- **Linear polarization:** The electric field vector oscillates along a fixed line, corresponding to a degenerate ellipse with infinite axial ratio. Examples include the radiation from an ideal linear dipole or a uniform line current.
- **Circular polarization:** The electric field vector has constant magnitude and rotates uniformly in a circle. At radian frequency $\omega$, this rotation may occur in one of two senses:
    - **Left-hand circular polarization (LHCP):** Looking in the direction of wave propagation, the field vector rotates clockwise.
    - **Right-hand circular polarization (RHCP):** Looking in the direction of wave propagation, the field vector rotates counterclockwise.
- **Elliptical polarization:** The most general case, where the electric field vector traces out an ellipse with finite axial ratio

A helix antenna, for example, produces circular polarization, with the handedness determined by the sense of the winding.

Consider a monochromatic plane wave propagating in the $z$-direction, with instantaneous electric field

$$
  \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t) = E_x (t) \unitvec{x} + E_y (t) \unitvec{y}
$$

Let the field components be harmonic with angular frequency $\omega$

$$
\begin{align*}
  E_x (t) =& E_1 \cos(\omega t) \\
  E_y (t) =& E_2 \cos(\omega t + \delta) \unitvec{y}
\end{align*}
$$

where $E_1, E_2 \geq 0$ are the field amplitudes along the $x$- and $y$-axes, and $\delta\in (-\pi, \pi]$ is the relative phase. If the components are in-phase ($\delta = 0$), the net vector is linearly polarized. The orientation of the linear polarization depends on the relative values of $E_1$ and $E_2$
- $E_1 = 0$ gives vertical polarization
- $E_2 = 0$ gives horizontal polarization
- $E_1 = E_2$ gives linear polarization at $45\deg$ with respect to the axes

The axial ratio (AR) of the polarization ellipse is defined as the ratio of the magnitudes of the major to the minor axes:

$$
  |\mathrm{AR}| := \frac{E_\text{major}}{E_\text{minor}},\; 1 \leq |\mathrm{AR}| \leq \infty
$$

In particular,
- $\mathrm{AR} = \infty$ corresponds to linear polarization.
- $|\mathrm{AR}| = 1$ corresponds to circular polarization.
- Finite $|\mathrm{AR}|$ corresponds to elliptical polarization.

The ellipticity angle $\epsilon$ is defined by

$$
  \epsilon = \cot^{-1} (-\mathrm{AR}) \in \left[-\frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right]
$$

so that $\epsilon = 0$ yields linear polarization, while $\epsilon = \pm \pi/4$ yields circular polarization. The sign of $\mathrm{AR}$ encodes the handedness: 
- $\mathrm{AR} > 0$: right-hand polarization
- $\mathrm{AR} < 0$: left-hand polarization

Axial ratio is often expressed in decibels as $\mathrm{AR}_\text{dB} = 20 \log_{10}(|\mathrm{AR}|)$. 

The tilt angle $\tau$ specifies the orientation of the ellipse relative to the $x$-axis, defined as the angle between the $x$-axis and the major axis of the ellipsis.

The phasor representation of the electric field is

$$
  \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = E_1 \unitvec{x} + E_2 e^{j\delta}
$$

which can be normalized as

$$
  \mathbf{E} = |E| \left(\cos(\gamma) \unitvec{x} + \sin(\gamma) e^{j\delta} \unitvec{y} \right)
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
  |E| =& \sqrt{E_1^2 + E_2^2} \\
  \gamma =& \tan^{-1} \left(\frac{E_2}{E_1} \right) \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]
\end{align*}
$$

The unit vector

$$
  \unitvec{e} = \cos(\gamma) \unitvec{x} + \sin(\gamma) e^{j\delta} \unitvec{y}
$$

encodes the polarization state.  Thus, $\gamma$ and $\delta$ uniquely characterizes the polarization. The two parametrizations $(\epsilon, \tau)$ and $(\gamma, \delta)$ are equivalent. The transformation between these angles are

$$
\begin{align*}
  \gamma =& \frac{1}{2} \cos^{-1} \left[\cos(2\epsilon) \cos(2\tau)\right] \\
  \delta =& \tan^{-1} \left(\frac{\tan(2\epsilon)}{\sin(2\tau)}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

## Receiving properties of antennas

A receiving antenna converts converts incident electromagnetic radiation into terminal voltage and currect at the connected transmission line. The received power can be equivalently expressed in terms of the incident electric field intensity or the incident power density.

In the incident field approach, the receiving antenna converts the incident electric field $\mathbf{E}_i$ to an open-circuit voltage $V_A$ characterized by the effective length $\mathbf{h}(\theta, \phi)$ through the relation

$$
  V_a = \mathbf{E}_i \cdot \mathbf{h}^*
$$

This expression can also be derived from basic electromagnetics using reciprocity. In terms of the polarization mismatch angle $\alpha_p$ between $\mathbf{E}_i$ and $\mathbf{h}$, the output voltage can be written

$$
  V_A = \norm{\mathbf{E}_i} \cdot \norm{\mathbf{h}} \cos(\alpha_p)
$$

Thus, maximum output voltage occurs when the wave arrives from a direction of peak receive antenna pattern response and is matched to the polarization of the receive antenna.

For a linearly polarized plane wave with electric field amplitude $E_i$, the effective length is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
  h = \frac{V_A}{E_i}
\tag{\label{equation-2}}
\end{equation*}
$$

<MathBox title="Effective length of an ideal dipole" boxType="example">
The radiation electric field of an ideal dipole is given by

$$
  \mathbf{E} = i\frac{\omega\mu I}{4\pi} \frac{e^{-i\beta r}}{r} \Delta z \sin(\theta) \unitsym{\theta}
$$

Since $\mathbf{h}$ contains information on the size of the antenna and the angular dependence of the radiation pattern, we can define 

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{h} := \Delta z \sin(\theta) \unitsym{\theta}
\tag{\label{equation-6}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that the dimension of $\mathbf{h}$ is length, and for the ideal dipole, the effective length is the same as the projection of the physical length viewed from angle $\theta$. This is not, however, true in general. Polarization information for the wave and antenna are contained in $\mathbf{E}_i$ and $\mathbf{h}$, respectively.
</MathBox>

In the power density approach, the receiving antenna converts the incident power density $S$ into received power by the "collecting area" of the receiving antenna called *maximum effective aperture* $A_\text{em}$ as expressed by the defining relation

$$
\begin{equation*}
  P_\text{rm} = S A_\text{em}
\tag{\label{equation-3}}
\end{equation*}
$$

The maximum available received power $P_\text{rm}$ is attained when the antenna is oriented for peak response, is polarization-matched to the wave, and is impedance-matched to its load.

We can now combine the two antenna-wave interaction relations. A receive antenna can be described by the circuit given in Figure 
$\ref{figure-1}$. Let the antenna impedance be $Z_A = R_A + jX_A$ and load impedance be $Z_L = R_L + jX_L$. By $\ref{figure-1}$, the received power is given by

$$
  P_\text{rm} = \frac{1}{2} |I_A|^2 R_L = \frac{1}{2} \frac{|V_A|^2}{(R_A + R_L)^2 + (X_A + X_L)^2} R_L
$$

Maximum power will be received when the load impedance is conjugate-matched to the antenna impedance

$$
  Z_L = R_L + j X_L = R_A - j X_A
$$

For a conjugate match, this reduces to

$$
\begin{equation*}
  P_\text{rm} = \frac{1}{8} \frac{|V_A|^2}{R_A}
\tag{\label{equation-4}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using the voltage for the case of a linearly polarized antenna from $\eqref{equation-2}$ for simplicity in $\eqref{equation-4}$ and equating to $\eqref{equation-3}$ yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  P_\text{rm} =& \frac{1}{8}\frac{|V_A|^2}{R_A} \\
  =& \frac{1}{8} \frac{|E_i h|^2}{R_A} = SA_\text{em} \\
  =& \frac{1}{2} \frac{|E_i|^2}{\eta} A_\text{em}
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-5}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the power density expression for the incoming wave is

$$
  S = \frac{1}{2} |\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}^*| = \frac{1}{2}{|E_i|^2}{\eta}
$$

Solving $\eqref{equation-5}$ for $h$ results in

$$
  h = 2\sqrt{\frac{R_A A_\text{em}}{\eta}}
$$

In practice, effective length is used is association with linear antennas such as dipoles and effective aperture is used with aperture antennas such as parabolic reflectors.

<MathBox title="Maximum effective aperture of an ideal dipole" boxType="example">
The maximum effective aperture for the ideal dipole is found using $\eqref{equation-4}$ and $\eqref{equation-5}$ with $\eqref{equation-6}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  A_\text{em} =& \frac{P_\text{rm}}{S} = \frac{\frac{1}{8} \frac{|V_A|^2}{R_r}}{\frac{1}{2}\frac{|E_i|^2}{\eta}} \\
  =& \frac{1}{4} \frac{\eta}{R_r} {|E_i|^2 (\Delta z)^2}{|E_i|^2} \\
  =& \frac{1}{4} \frac{\eta}{R_r} (\Delta z)^2 \\
  =& \frac{1}{4} \frac{\eta (\Delta z)^2}{\eta \frac{2}{3} \pi \left(\frac{\Delta z}{\lambda}\right)^2} \\
  =& \frac{3}{8\pi} \lambda^2
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-7}}
\end{equation*}
$$

This result is counterintuitive because it shows the the maximum effective aperture of an ideal dipole is independent of its length $\Delta z$ (as long as $\Delta z \ll \lambda$). However, the dipole length cannot be reduced arbitrarily without penalty. Here $R_r$ is proportional to $(\Delta z/\lambda)^2$ so that even though $A_\text{em}$ remains constant as the dipole is shortened, its radiation resistance decreases rapidly and the maximum effective aperture will probably not be realized because of the difficulty in achieving the required conjugate impedance match of the receiver to the antenna.
</MathBox>

Another quantity characterizing a receiving antenna is *antenna factor* $K$, defined as

$$
\begin{equation*}
  K = \frac{E_i}{V_L}
\tag{\label{equation-8}}
\end{equation*}
$$

which gives the output voltage $V_L$ across a load. It includes impedance mismatches but not transmission line losses. If a high-impedance load is used, the voltage in $\eqref{equation-8}$ is an open-circuit voltage and equals the inverse of the effective length in $\eqref{equation-2}$, i.e. $K = h^{-1}$.

## Antenna noise

Any material in the environment surrounding an antenna radiate electromagnetic waves, as dictated by blackbody radiation. The antenna collects this noisy radiation through its antenna pattern. Because thermal noise is incoherent, the contributions from different directions add in power rather than in field amplitude, producing a noise contribution at the antenna output in addition to the desired signal.

From noise theory, the available noise power $P_\text{N}$ delivered by a noise resistor at temperature $T$ in a bandwidth $\Delta f$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
  P_\text{N} = kT\Delta T
\tag{\label{equation-10}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ JK}^{-1}$ is Boltzmann's constant. This is known as *Nyquist noise* or *Johnson noise*.

The antenna noise contribution is computed by determining the antenna temperature $T_A$. This is not the physical temperature of the antenna itself, but rather an equivalent noise temperature defined such that the noise power available at the antenna output is the same as if the antenna were connected to a matched thermal source at temperature $T_A$. Thus, $T_A$ characterizes the effective noise environment as seen through the antenna pattern.

The antenna temperature is computed by averaging the environment temperature distribution $T(\theta, \phi)$, weighted by the normalized antenna power pattern $P_n (\theta, \phi)$

$$
\begin{equation*}
  T_A = \frac{1}{\Omega_A} \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} T(\theta, \phi) P_n (\theta, \phi) \;\d\Omega
\tag{\label{equation-9}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Expectedly, if the scene is of constant temperature $T_o$ over all angles, then $T_A = T_o$. In this csae the antenna is completely surrounded by noise of temperature $T_o$ and its output antenna temperature equals $T_o$ independent of the antenna patttern shape. Consider the case of a discrete source of small solid angular extent $\Omega_s$ with constant temperature $T_s$ and observed with an antenna beam directed toward its center that is broad compared to the source. Then $P_n (\theta, \phi) \approx 1$ over the source and $\eqref{equation-9}$ reduces to

$$
  T_A = \frac{\Omega_s}{T_A} T_s
$$

For a circularly symmetric source or circularly symmetric antenna beam, the solid angles $\Omega_s$ and $\Omega_A$ are proportional to the angular extent of the source squared and $\text{HP}^2$, respectively.

The environmental temperature distribution $T(\theta, \phi)$ generally consists of two components: ground noise and sky noise. The noise temperature of ground in most situations is well approximated by $290 \text{ K}$, but is much less for reflecting surfaces and smooth surfaces at or near grazing incidence angles.

Unlike ground noise, sky noise is a strong function of frequency and is made up of atmospheric, cosmic and manmande noise.
- Below about $10 \text{ MHz}$ external noise is very strong and usually exceeds the internal noise of a receiver, so antenna efficiency and directivity have litte effect on signal-to-noise ratio.
- From $10$ to $100 \text{ MHz}$, natural noise is a combination of atmospheric and cosmic noise.
- From $100 \text{ MHz}$ to $1 \text{ GHz}$, cosmic noise dominates.
- The band between $1$ and $10 \text{ GHz}$ is the lowest noise regime and noise increases with decreasing elevation angle due to the finite heigh of the atmosphere with the path length through the atmosphere becoming lower for elevation angles. This makes this frequency region desireable for many wireleess applications. Also evident in this band is the irreducible sky background temperature of $3K$, which is theorized to be the residual effect of big bang.
- Above $10 \text{ GHz}$ atmospheric noise again dominates, increasing with frequency due to water vapor and hydrometer absorption, which vary with season and location. Atmospheric gases also are noise sources and include strong, broad spectral lines.

The total system noise power is the sum of the antenna output noise and the input receiver noise power. The noise temperatures add also and the total system noise temperature is found as

$$
  T_\text{sys} = T_A + T_r
$$

where $T_r$ is the receiver input noise temperature.

### Carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR)

In most communications and active remote-sensing systems, the noise power must be sufficiently below the signal power for proper operation. In these cases, the system is evaluated using *carrier-to-noise ratio* (CNR), whic is the ratio of the signal power to the system noise power.

$$
  \mathrm{CNR} = \frac{P_D}[P_{\text{N, sys}}]
$$

where
- $P_D$ is the carrier power delivered from the antenna $[\text{W}]$
- $P_{\text{N, sys}}$ is system noise power $[\text{W}]$

The parameter closely related to CNR is signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which uses the signal power after demodulation.

### Radiometry

A radiometer is a receiving system used to measure noise in passive remote-sensing applications. It pick up noise from "hot" objects and can form an image by scanning through a noise scene, usually with a narrow-beam antenna. Extraterrestial noise is quantified in a unit called a *jansky* ($= 10^{-26} \text{ Wm}^{-2} \text{Hz}^{-1})$ in honor of Karl Jansky (1905-1950), who first measured extraterrestial noise during and accidental radio astronomy observation in $1933$.

## Directivity, gain and effective aperture

Directivity is directly proportional to maximum effective aperture.

### Dipole

The directivity of the ideal dipole is given by

$$
  D = \frac{3}{2} = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda^2} \frac{3}{8\pi} \lambda^2
$$

# Radar

If the distance between the antenna and the target in the radar channel is sufficiently large, then both objects lie in each other's far field. The far field is the region in which the radiated or received field can be approximated by a locally plane wave. For an antenna with aperture of maximum geometric extent $A$, the far field distance of its radiated field is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
  R_{\text{FF}} = \frac{2A}{\lambda}
\tag{\label{equation-1}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\lambda$ denotes the free-space wavelength.

## Radar equation

The radar equation relates the range of the target, the transmitted power and the characteristics of the targets to the received power.

### Point targets

When deriving the radar equation for point targets, it is assumed that there is exactly one target in the radar channel between the transmit and receive antennas. Consider a radar system with a single transmitting antenna radiating a power $P_\text{tx}$. For an isotropic antenna, 

If  is radiated by the transmit antenna and is distributed isotropically on a spherical surface expanding at the speed of light $c_0$ around the antenna. This leads to the isotropic power density

$$
  S_{\text{tx}, i} = \frac{P_\text{tx}}{4\pi r^2}
$$

Since real antennas do not radiate isotropically, but are focused with the gain $G_\text{tx}$ in the main beam direction, the power density is

$$
  S_\text{tx} = \frac{P_\text{tx} G_\text{tx}}{4\pi r^2}
$$

The target is assumed to be in the main beam direction of the antenna. The wave propagates from the transmitter to the target. This range between transmitter and target is $R$. The actual power density at the target is therefore

$$
  S_\text{tx} = \frac{P_\text{tx} G_\text{tx}}{4\pi R^2}
$$

This power is scattered back from the target object. The property of the target that describes this backscatter is called the radar-cross section (RCS) $\sigma_\text{rcs}$ and has the unit of an area. The backscattered power is given by

$$
  P_s = S_\text{tx} \sigma_\text{rcs}
$$

This backscattering now again leads to a wave that propagates spherically from the target in all spatial directions. This results in the power density

$$
  S_s = \frac{P_s}{4\pi R_s^2} = \frac{P_\text{tx} G_\text{tx}}{4\pi R^2} \sigma_\text{rcs} \frac{1}{4\pi R_s^2}
$$

of the backscattered wave at a range $R_s$ from the target object. If the transmitter and the receiver are at the same location, the power denisty with $R_s = R$ at the receiver is

$$
  S_s = \frac{P_\text{tx} G_\text{tx}}{(4\pi R^2)^2} \sigma_\text{rcs}
$$

The waves with this power density are received by the receive antenna. With the effective antenna are $A_\text{e}$, the following applies to the received power $P_\text{rx}$

$$
  P_\text{tx} = A_\text{e, rx} S_s
$$

Adding the gain of the receive antenna

$$
  G_\text{rx} = \frac{4\pi A_\text{e, rx}}{\lambda^2}
$$

the receive power becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
  P_\text{rx} = P_\text{tx} \frac{G_\text{tx} G_\text{rx} \lambda^2}{(4\pi)^3 R^4} \sigma_\text{rcs}
\tag{\label{equation-2}}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation is known as the radar equation for point targets. The minimum received power $P_\text{rx, min}$ that can still be processed is often known for radar sensors. This allows for the maximum range $R_\text{max}$ of a radar to be calculateada for a given transmit power

$$
  R_\text{max} = \sqrt[4]{P_\text{tx} \frac{G_\text{tx} G_\text{rx} \lambda^2}{(4\pi)^3 P_\text{rx, min}}}
$$

As can be seen, the receive power of a radar sensor decreases with the fourth power of the range $R$ between the target and the sensor. Doubling the range leads to a reduction in receive power by a factor of $16$. This is due to the two spherical wave, which propagate between the transmitter and the target with $1/R^2$ each and a product in $\eqref{equation-2}$ ultimately lead to $1/R^4$. The resulting strong attenuation of the signal in the channel between the radar sensor and the target means that a radar sensor must be able to process very weak signals. If very different ranges occur in an application, the radar channel is highly dynamic. The dynamics of the radar channel is the ratio of the maximum received power from targets at close range to the minimum received power for targets at maximum range.

  =& \frac{}
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-}}

where the angular part $\Lambda^2$, called the Legendrian, is

$$
