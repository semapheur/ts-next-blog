## Electromagnetic radiation

### Time-harmonic Maxwell equations

The fundamental electromagnetic equations in differential form are

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla\times\mathbf{E} =& -\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \tag{\label{equation-12}} \\
  \nabla\times\mathbf{H} =& \frac{\partial\mathbf{D}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{J}_\text{t} \tag{\label{equation-13}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\mathbf{D} =& \rho_\text{t} \tag{\label{equation-14}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} =& 0 \tag{\label{equation-15}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}_\text{t} = -\frac{\partial\rho_\text{t}}{\partial t} \tag{\label{equation-16}}
\end{align*}
$$

where the first four are Maxwell's equations and the last is the continuity equation.

If the impressed sources $\rho_\text{t} (\mathbf{r}, t)$ and $\mathbf{J}_\text{t} (\mathbf{r}, t)$ vary sinusoidally at radian frequency $\omega > 0$, then linearity of Maxwell's equation all fields will respond sinusoidally at the same frequency. The fundamental electromagnetic equations are considerably simplified by introducing phasor fields of the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t) =& \Re(\tilde{\mathbf{E}}(\mathbf{r}) e^{j\omega t}) \\
  \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{r}, t) =& \Re(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}(\mathbf{r}) e^{j\omega t})
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-11}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the phasor quantities $\tilde{\mathbf{E}}$, $\tilde{\mathbf{H}}$, $\tilde{\mathbf{D}}$, $\tilde{\mathbf{B}}$, are complex vector fields and $\tilde{\rho}_\text{T}$ is a complex scalar field, all depending only on spatial coordinates. Substituting $\eqref{equation-11}$ into $\eqref{equation-12}$-$\eqref{equation-16}$ and eliminating the phase factors $e^{j\omega t}$ yields the time-harmonic Maxwell system

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{E}} =& -j\omega\tilde{\mathbf{B}} \tag{\label{equation-17}} \\
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{H}} =& j\omega\mathbf{D} + \tilde{\mathbf{J}}_\text{t} \tag{\label{equation-18}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{D}} =& \rho_\text{t} \tag{\label{equation-19}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{B}} =& 0 \tag{\label{equation-20}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{J}}_\text{t} =& -j\omega \tilde{\rho}_\text{t} \tag{\label{equation-21}}
\end{align*}
$$

If multiple frequency is present, the full time-domain solution can be recovered by inverse Fourier transform of phasor solutions.

The total current density $\tilde\mathbf{J}$ decomposes into a conduction current and an impressed current

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{J}}_\text{t} = \sigma\tilde{\mathbf{E}} + \tilde{\mathbf{J}}
\tag{\label{equation-22}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\sigma \geq 0$ is the conductity. The current density $\sigma\tilde{\mathbf{E}}$ is induced on a nearby conductor due to the fields created by the source $\mathbf{J}_s$. In addition to conductivity $\sigma$, a material is further characterized by permittivity $\varepsilon$ and permeability $\mu$. For isotropic, homogenous media we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{D}} =& \varepsilon\tilde{\mathbf{E}} \tag{\label{equation-23}} \\
  \tilde{\mathbf{B}} =& \mu\tilde{\mathbf{B}} \tag{\label{equation-24}}
\end{align*}
$$

Substituting $\eqref{equation-22}$ and $\eqref{equation-23}$ into $\eqref{equation-18}$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{H}} =& j\omega\left(\varepsilon + \frac{\sigma}{j\omega} \right) \tilde{\mathbf{E}} + \tilde{\mathbf{J}} \\
  =& j\omega\varepsilon' \tilde{\mathbf{E}} + \tilde{\mathbf{J}}
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-25}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where we have introduce the complex permittivity $\varepsilon' = \varepsilon - j(\sigma/\omega)$. Let $\rho$ be the source charge corresponding to the source current density $\tilde{\mathbf{J}}$. Then using $\eqref{equation-22}$ to $\eqref{equation-25}$ in $\eqref{equation-17}$ and $\eqref{equation-19}$ to $\eqref{equation-11}$, and repeating $\eqref{equation-25}$ permits Maxwell's equations to be expressed in terms of $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{H}$

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{E}} =& -j\omega\mu\tilde{\mathbf{H}} \tag{\label{equation-26}} \\
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{H}} =& -j\omega\varepsilon' \tilde{\mathbf{E}} + \tilde{\mathbf{J}} \tag{\label{equation-27}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{E}} =& \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon'} \tag{\label{equation-28}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{H}} =& 0 \tag{\label{equation-29}} \\
  \nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{J}} =& -j\omega\rho \tag{\label{equation-30}}
\end{align*}
$$

Introducing a fictitious magnetic current density $\mathbf{M}$, we can rewrite $\eqref{equation-26}$ as

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{E}} = -j\omega\mu\tilde{\mathbf{H}} - \mathbf{M}
\tag{\label{equation-31}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Magnetic currents are useful as equivalent sources that replace complicated electric fields. 

Across an interface between two homogenous media with constitutive parameters $\varepsilon_k$, $\mu_k$, $\sigma_k$ for $k = 1,2$, the time-harmonic boundary conditions are

$$
\begin{align*}
  \unitvec{n}\times(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_2 - \tilde{\mathbf{H}}_1) =& \mathbf{J}_s \\
  (\tilde{\mathbf{E}}_2 - \tilde{\mathbf{E}}_1) \times\unitvec{n} =& \mathbf{M}_s
\end{align*}
$$

where $\unitvec{n}$ is the unit normal directed from medium $1$ into medium $2$, and $\mathbf{J}_s$ and $\mathbf{M}_s$ denote electric and magnetic surface currents. The magnetic suface current $\mathbf{M}_s$ is zero unless an equivalent magnetic current sheet is used. The cross product with the unit normal form the tangential components to the boundary

$$
\begin{align*}
  H_{\text{tan},2} =& H_{\text{tan},1} + J_s \\
  E_{\text{tan},2} =& E_{\text{tan},1} + M_s
\end{align*}
$$

These boundary conditions are derived from the integral form of $\eqref{equation-27}$ and $\eqref{equation-31}$. If one side is a perfect electrical conductor, the boundary conditions become

$$
\begin{align*}
  H_\text{tan} =& J_s \\
  E_\text{tan} =& 0
\end{align*}
$$

### Poynting's theorem

Consider a volume $\nu \subseteq\R^3$ bounded by a closed surface $s = \partial\nu$. By Poynting's theorem the complex power balance is

$$
  P_s = P_f + \braket{P_d} + j2\omega(\braket{W_m} - \braket{W_e})
$$

where
- $P_s$ is the complex power delivered by impressed sources
- $P_f$ is the outward complex power flux
- $\braket{P_d}$ is the time-averaged dissipated power 
- $\braket{W_m}$, $\braket{W_e}$ are time-averaged stored magnetic and electric energies

The complex power flowing out of through the closed surface $s$ is given by

$$
  P_\text{f} = \frac{1}{2} \oiint_s \tilde{\mathbf{E}} \times \tilde{\mathbf{H}}^* \cdot \d\mathbf{s}
$$

where $\d\mathbf{s} = \d s \unitvec{n}$ and $\unitvec{n}$ is the unit normal to the surface directed out from the surface. The integrand is defined as the Poynting vector

$$
  \mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{2} \tilde{\mathbf{E}} \times\tilde{\mathbf{H}}^*
$$

which is a power density with units $\text{W}/\text{m}^2$.

The dissipated power and stored energies are

$$
\begin{align*}
  \braket{P_\text{d}} =& \frac{1}{2} \iiint_nu \sigma |\tilde{E}|^2 \;\d\nu \\
  \braket{W_m} =& \frac{1}{2} \iiint_\nu \frac{1}{2} \mu |\tilde{H}|^2 \;\d\nu \\
  \braket{W_e} =& \frac{1}{2} \iiint_\nu \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon' |\tilde{E}|^2 \;\d\nu
\end{align*}
$$

If the source distribution is known, the complex source power can be computed directly from

$$
  P_s = -\frac{1}{2} \iiint_\nu \tilde{\mathbf{E}} \cdot\tilde{\mathbf{J}}^* \;\d\nu
$$

with an additional contribution $\frac{1}{2} \iiint_\nu \tilde{\mathbf{H}}^* \cdot \tilde{\mathbf{M}} \;\d\nu$ if magnetic current density is present.

The real power flowing through an arbitray surface $s$ is

$$
  \braket{P} = \Re\left(\iint_s \mathbf{S} \cdot \d\mathbf{s} \right)
$$

### Radiation fields

The antenna problem consist of solving for the electromagnetic fields that are created by an impressed current distribution $\tilde{\mathbf{J}}$. The fields $\tilde{\mathbf{E}}$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{H}}$ are determined by the curl equations $\eqref{equation-26}$ and $\eqref{equation-27}$, which are two coupled linear first-order differential equation. In order to simplify the solution for $\tilde{\mathbf{E}}$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{H}}$ with a given $\tilde{\mathbf{J}}$, we introduce the scalar potential $\Phi$ and the vector potential $\mathbf{A}$.

By $\eqref{equation-29}$, the magnetic field is divergenceless allowing us to define $\tilde{\mathbf{H}}$ as the curl of a magnetic vector potential $\mathbf{A}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{H}} = \frac{1}{\mu} \nabla\times\mathbf{A}
\tag{\label{equation-32}}
\end{equation*}
$$

since $\nabla\cdot\nabla\times\mathbf{A} \equiv 0$ for any $\mathbf{A}$. The scalar potential is derived by substituting $\eqref{equation-32}$ into $\eqref{equation-26}$ resulting in

$$
  \nabla\times(\tilde{\mathbf{E}} + j\omega\mathbf{A}) = \mathbf{0}
$$

Since the expression in the parentheses is curl free, it is a conservative field and behaves as a static electric field. The electric scalar potential $\Phi$ is defined from

$$
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}} + j\omega\mathbf{A} = -\nabla\Phi
$$
 
which satisfies $\nabla \times (-\nabla\Phi) \equiv \mathbf{0}$. The electric field can be written

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}} = -j\omega\mathbf{A} -\nabla\Phi
\tag{\label{equation-33}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting $\eqref{equation-32}$ into $\eqref{equation-27}$ gives

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla\times\tilde{\mathbf{H}} =& \frac{1}{\mu} \nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{A} \\
  =& j\omega\varepsilon' \tilde{\mathbf{E}} + \tilde{\mathbf{J}}
\end{align*}
$$

Using the vector identity

$$
  \nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{A} = \nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A}
$$

and inserting $\eqref{equation-33}$ we obtain

$$
  \nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = j\omega\mu\varepsilon' \Phi + \nabla\cdot\mathbf{A} + \mu\tilde{\mathbf{J}}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} + \omega^2 \mu\varepsilon' \mathbf{A} - \nabla(j\omega\mu\varepsilon' \Phi + \nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}) = -\mu\tilde{\mathbf{J}}
\tag{\label{equation-34}}
\end{equation*}
$$

To eliminate the gradient term of $\eqref{equation-34}$ we can use the Lorentz condition

$$
  \nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}= -j\omega\mu\varepsilon' \Phi
$$

so that $\eqref{equation-34}$ simplifies to

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} + \omega^2 \mu\varepsilon' \mathbf{A} = -\mu\tilde{\mathbf{J}}
\tag{\label{equation-35}}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is known as the vector wave equation. Solving for $\mathbf{A}$ we can determine the electric field from

$$
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}} = -j\omega\mathbf{A} - j\frac{\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A})}{\omega\mu\varepsilon'}
$$

A more cumbersome approach would be to solve the scalar wave equation

$$
  \nabla^2 \Phi + \omega^2 \mu\varepsilon' \Phi = -\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon'}
$$

in addition to the vector wave equation.

From $\eqref{equation-35}$ we recognize the coefficient $\beta = \omega\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon'}$ as the phase constant for a propagating wave. By definition a wave shift $2\pi$ radians of phase for one full cycle, corresponding to one wavelength $\lambda$, so that

$$
  \beta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
$$

since $\lambda = c/f$ and $\omega = 2\pi f$, we have

$$
  \beta = \frac{2\pi f}{c} = \frac{\omega}{c}
$$

implying that $c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon'}}$.

For a point source, the wave equation takes the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla^2 \psi + \beta^2 = -\delta(x) \delta(y) \delta(z)
\tag{\label{equation-36}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\psi$ is the response to a point source at the origin, and $\delta$ is the Dirac delta function. Despite the infinitesimal extent of a point source, its associated current has a direction. If the point source current is taken as $z$-directed, then

$$
  \psi = A_z
$$

Because the point source is zero except at the origin $\eqref{equation-36}$ becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla^2 \psi + \beta^2 \psi = 0
\tag{\label{equation-37}}
\end{equation*}
$$

away from the origin. This is the complex scalar wave equation, also known as the Helmholtz equation. Due to spherical symmetry, the Laplacian is written in spherical coordinates and $\psi$ has only radial dependence. The two solutions to $\eqref{equation-37}$ are $e^{\pm j\beta r} / r$, which correspond to waves propagating radially outward and inward, respectively. The physically meaningful solution is the one for waves traveling away from the point source, resulting in

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \psi = \frac{e^{-j\beta r}}{4\pi r}
\tag{\label{equation-38}}
\end{equation*}
$$

With respect to an observation point $P$ at an arbitrary position $\mathbf{r}_P$, the position of the point source is $\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{r}_P - \mathbf{r}$, so that $\eqref{equation-38}$ is given in terms of $R = \norm{\mathbf{r}_P - \mathbf{r}}$, i.e.

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \psi = \frac{e^{-j\beta R}}{4\pi R}
\tag{\label{equation-39}}
\end{equation*}
$$

If we consider the source to be a collection of point sources weighted by the distribution $\tilde{\mathbf{J}}$, the response $\mathbf{A}$ is a sum of the point source responses of $\eqref{equation-39}$. This is expressed by the integal over the source volume $\nu'$

$$
  \mathbf{A} = \iiint_{\nu'} \mu \tilde{\mathbf{J}} \frac{e^{-j\beta R}}{4\pi R} \;\d\nu'
$$

### The ideal dipole

### Radiation patterns

### Directivity and gain

### Antenna impedance

### Radiation efficiency

### Antenna polarization


If the distance between the antenna and the target in the radar channel is sufficiently large, then both objects lie in each other's far field. The far field is the region in which the radiated or received field can be approximated by a locally plane wave. For an antenna with aperture of maximum geometric extent $A$, the far field distance of its radiated field is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
  R_{\text{FF}} = \frac{2A}{\lambda}
\tag{\label{equation-1}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\lambda$ denotes the free-space wavelength.

## Receiving properties of antennas

A receiving antenna converts converts incident electromagnetic radiation into terminal voltage and currect at the connected transmission line. The received power can be equivalently expressed in terms of the incident electric field intensity or the incident power density.

In the incident field approach, the receiving antenna converts the incident electric field $\mathbf{E}_i$ to an open-circuit voltage $V_A$ characterized by the effective length $\mathbf{h}(\theta, \phi)$ through the relation

$$
  V_a = \mathbf{E}_i \cdot \mathbf{h}^*
$$

This expression can also be derived from basic electromagnetics using reciprocity. In terms of the polarization mismatch angle $\alpha_p$ between $\mathbf{E}_i$ and $\mathbf{h}$, the output voltage can be written

$$
  V_A = \norm{\mathbf{E}_i} \cdot \norm{\mathbf{h}} \cos(\alpha_p)
$$

Thus, maximum output voltage occurs when the wave arrives from a direction of peak receive antenna pattern response and is matched to the polarization of the receive antenna.

For a linearly polarized plane wave with electric field amplitude $E_i$, the effective length is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
  h = \frac{V_A}{E_i}
\tag{\label{equation-2}}
\end{equation*}
$$

<MathBox title="Effective length of an ideal dipole" boxType="example">
The radiation electric field of an ideal dipole is given by

$$
  \mathbf{E} = i\frac{\omega\mu I}{4\pi} \frac{e^{-i\beta r}}{r} \Delta z \sin(\theta) \unitsym{\theta}
$$

Since $\mathbf{h}$ contains information on the size of the antenna and the angular dependence of the radiation pattern, we can define 

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{h} := \Delta z \sin(theta) \unitsym{\theta}$
\tag{\label{equation-6}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that the dimension of $\mathbf{h}$ is length, and for the ideal dipole, the effective length is the same as the projection of the physical length viewed from angle $\theta$. This is not, however, true in general. Polarization information for the wave and antenna are contained in $\mathbf{E}_i$ and $\mathbf{h}$, respectively.
</MathBox>

In the power density approach, the receiving antenna converts the incident power density $S$ into received power by the "collecting area" of the receiving antenna called *maximum effective aperture* $A_\text{em}$ as expressed by the defining relation

$$
\begin{equation*}
  P_\text{rm} = S A_\text{em}
\tag{\label{equation-3}}
\end{equation*}
$$

The maximum available received power $P_\text{rm}$ is attained when the antenna is oriented for peak response, is polarization-matched to the wave, and is impedance-matched to its load.

</LatexFigure>

We can now combine the two antenna-wave interaction relations. A receive antenna can be described by the circuit given in Figure 
$\ref{figure-1}$. Let the antenna impedance be $Z_A = R_A + jX_A$ and load impedance be $Z_L = R_L + jX_L$. By $\ref{figure-1}$, the received power is given by

$$
  P_\text{rm} = \frac{1}{2} |I_A|^2 R_L = \frac{1}{2} \frac{|V_A|^2}{(R_A + R_L)^2 + (X_A + X_L)^2} R_L
$$

Maximum power will be received when the load impedance is conjugate-matched to the antenna impedance

$$
  Z_L = R_L + j X_L = R_A - j X_A
$$

For a conjugate match, this reduces to

$$
\begin{equation*}
  P_\text{rm} = \frac{1}{8} \frac{|V_A|^2}{R_A}
\tag{\label{equation-4}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using the voltage for the case of a linearly polarized antenna from $\eqref{equation-2}$ for simplicity in $\eqref{equation-4}$ and equating to $\eqref{equation-3}$ yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  P_\text{rm} =& \frac{1}{8}\frac{|V_A|^2}{R_A} \\
  =& \frac{1}{8} \frac{|E_i h|^2}{R_A} = SA_\text{em} \\
  =& \frac{1}{2} \frac{|E_i|^2}{\eta} A_\text{em}
\end{split}
\tag{\label{equation-5}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the power density expression for the incoming wave is

$$
  S = \frac{1}{2} |\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}^*| = \frac{1}{2}{|E_i|^2}{\eta}
$$

Solving $\eqref{equation-5}$ for $h$ results in

$$
  h = 2\sqrt{\frac{R_A A_\text{em}}{\eta}}
$$

In practice, effective length is used is association with linear antennas such as dipoles and effective aperture is used with aperture antennas such as parabolic reflectors.

<MathBox title="Maximum effective aperture of an ideal dipole" boxType="example">
TMaximum effective aperture for the ideal dipole is found using $\eqref{equation-4}$ and $\eqref{equation-5}$ with $\eqref{equation-6}

$$
\begin{equation*}
  A_\text{em} =& \frac{P_\text{rm}}{S} = \frac{\frac{1}{8} \frac{|V_A|^2}{R_r}}{\frac{1}{2}\frac{|E_i|^2}{\eta}} \\
  =& \frac{1}{4} \frac{\eta}{R_r} {|E_i|^2 (\Delta z)^2}{|E_i|^2} \\
  =& \frac{1}{4} \frac{\eta}{R_r} (\Delta z)^2 \\
  =& \frac{1}{4} \frac{\eta (\Delta z)^2}{\eta \frac{2}{3} \pi \left(\frac{\Delta z}{\lambda}\right)^2} \\
  =& \frac{3}{8\pi} \lambda^2
\tag{\label{equation-7}}
\end{equation*}
$$

This result is counterintuitive because it shows the the maximum effective aperture of an ideal dipole is independent of its length $\Delta z$ (as long as $\Delta z \ll \lambda$). However, the dipole length cannot be reduced arbitrarily without penalty. Here $R_r$ is proportional to $(\Delta z/\lambda)^2$ so that even though $A_\text{em}$ remains constant as the dipole is shortened, its radiation resistance decreases rapidly and the maximum effective aperture will probably not be realized because of the difficulty in achieving the required conjugate impedance match of the receiver to the antenna.
</MathBox>

Another quantity characterizing a receiving antenna is *antenna factor* $K$, defined as

$$
\begin{equation*}
  K = \frac{E_i}{V_L}
\tag{\label{equation-8}}
\end{equation*}
$$

which gives the output voltage $V_L$ across a load. It includes impedance mismatches but not transmission line losses. If a high-impedance load is used, the voltage in $\eqref{equation-8}$ is an open-circuit voltage and equals the inverse of the effective length in $\eqref{equation-2}$, i.e. $K = h^{-1}$.

## Antenna noise

Any material in the environment surrounding an antenna radiate electromagnetic waves, as dictated by blackbody radiation. The antenna collects this noisy radiation through its antenna pattern. Because thermal noise is incoherent, the contributions from different directions add in power rather than in field amplitude, producing a noise contribution at the antenna output in addition to the desired signal.

From noise theory, the available noise power $P_\text{N}$ delivered by a noise resistor at temperature $T$ in a bandwidth $\Delta f$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
  P_\text{N} = kT\Delta T
\tag{\label{equation-10}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ JK}^{-1}$ is Boltzmann's constant. This is known as *Nyquist noise* or *Johnson noise*.

The antenna noise contribution is computed by determining the antenna temperature $T_A$. This is not the physical temperature of the antenna itself, but rather an equivalent noise temperature defined such that the noise power available at the antenna output is the same as if the antenna were connected to a matched thermal source at temperature $T_A$. Thus, $T_A$ characterizes the effective noise environment as seen through the antenna pattern.

The antenna temperature is computed by averaging the environment temperature distribution $T(\theta, \phi)$, weighted by the normalized antenna power pattern $P_n (\theta, \phi)$

$$
\begin{equation*}
  T_A = \frac{1}{\Omega_A} \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} T(\theta, \phi) P_n (\theta, \phi) \;\d\Omega
\tag{\label{equation-9}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Expectedly, if the scene is of constant temperature $T_o$ over all angles, then $T_A = T_o$. In this csae the antenna is completely surrounded by noise of temperature $T_o$ and its output antenna temperature equals $T_o$ independent of the antenna patttern shape. Consider the case of a discrete source of small solid angular extent $\Omega_s$ with constant temperature $T_s$ and observed with an antenna beam directed toward its center that is broad compared to the source. Then $P_n (\theta, \phi) \approx 1$ over the source and $\eqref{equation-9}$ reduces to

$$
  T_A = \frac{\Omega_s}{T_A} T_s
$$

For a circularly symmetric source or circularly symmetric antenna beam, the solid angles $\Omega_s$ and $\Omega_A$ are proportional to the angular extent of the source squared and $\text{HP}^2$, respectively.

The environmental temperature distribution $T(\theta, \phi)$ generally consists of two components: ground noise and sky noise. The noise temperature of ground in most situations is well approximated by $290 \text{ K}$, but is much less for reflecting surfaces and smooth surfaces at or near grazing incidence angles.

Unlike ground noise, sky noise is a strong function of frequency and is made up of atmospheric, cosmic and manmande noise.
- Below about $10 \text{ MHz}$ external noise is very strong and usually exceeds the internal noise of a receiver, so antenna efficiency and directivity have litte effect on signal-to-noise ratio.
- From $10$ to $100 \text{ MHz}$, natural noise is a combination of atmospheric and cosmic noise.
- From $100 \text{ MHz}$ to $1 \text{ GHz}$, cosmic noise dominates.
- The band between $1$ and $10 \text{ GHz}$ is the lowest noise regime and noise increases with decreasing elevation angle due to the finite heigh of the atmosphere with the path length through the atmosphere becoming lower for elevation angles. This makes this frequency region desireable for many wireleess applications. Also evident in this band is the irreducible sky background temperature of $3K$, which is theorized to be the residual effect of big bang.
- Above $10 \text{ GHz}$ atmospheric noise again dominates, increasing with frequency due to water vapor and hydrometer absorption, which vary with season and location. Atmospheric gases also are noise sources and include strong, broad spectral lines.

The total system noise power is the sum of the antenna output noise and the input receiver noise power. The noise temperatures add also and the total system noise temperature is found as

$$
  T_\text{sys} = T_A + T_r
$$

where $T_r$ is the receiver input noise temperature.

### Carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR)

In most communications and active remote-sensing systems, the noise power must be sufficiently below the signal power for proper operation. In these cases, the system is evaluated using *carrier-to-noise ratio* (CNR), whic is the ratio of the signal power to the system noise power.

$$
  \mathrm{CNR} = \frac{P_D}[P_{\text{N, sys}}]
$$

where
- $P_D$ is the carrier power delivered from the antenna $[\text{W}]$
- $P_{\text{N, sys}}$ is system noise power $[\text{W}]$

The parameter closely related to CNR is signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which uses the signal power after demodulation.

### Radiometry

A radiometer is a receiving system used to measure noise in passive remote-sensing applications. It pick up noise from "hot" objects and can form an image by scanning through a noise scene, usually with a narrow-beam antenna. Extraterrestial noise is quantified in a unit called a *jansky* ($= 10^{-26} \text{ Wm}^{-2} \text{Hz}^{-1})$ in honor of Karl Jansky (1905-1950), who first measured extraterrestial noise during and accidental radio astronomy observation in $1933$.

## Directivity, gain and effective aperture

Directivity is directly proportional to maximum effective aperture.

### Dipole

The directivity of the ideal dipole is given by

$$
  D = \frac{3}{2} = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda^2} \frac{3}{8\pi} \lambda^2
$$



# Radar

## Radar equation

The radar equation relates the range of the target, the transmitted power and the characteristics of the targets to the received power.

### Point targets

When deriving the radar equation for point targets, it is assumed that there is exactly one target in the radar channel between the transmit and receive antennas. Consider a radar system with a single transmitting antenna radiating a power $P_\text{tx}$. For an isotropic antenna, 

If  is radiated by the transmit antenna and is distributed isotropically on a spherical surface expanding at the speed of light $c_0$ around the antenna. This leads to the isotropic power density

$$
  S_{\text{tx}, i} = \frac{P_\text{tx}}{4\pi r^2}
$$

Since real antennas do not radiate isotropically, but are focused with the gain $G_\text{tx}$ in the main beam direction, the power density is

$$
  S_\text{tx} = \frac{P_\text{tx} G_\text{tx}}{4\pi r^2}
$$

The target is assumed to be in the main beam direction of the antenna. The wave propagates from the transmitter to the target. This range between transmitter and target is $R$. The actual power density at the target is therefore

$$
  S_\text{tx} = \frac{P_\text{tx} G_\text{tx}}{4\pi R^2}
$$

This power is scattered back from the target object. The property of the target that describes this backscatter is called the radar-cross section (RCS) $\sigma_\text{rcs}$ and has the unit of an area. The backscattered power is given by

$$
  P_s = S_\text{tx} \sigma_\text{rcs}
$$

This backscattering now again leads to a wave that propagates spherically from the target in all spatial directions. This results in the power density

$$
  S_s = \frac{P_s}{4\pi R_s^2} = \frac{P_\text{tx} G_\text{tx}}{4\pi R^2} \sigma_\text{rcs} \frac{1}{4\pi R_s^2}
$$

of the backscattered wave at a range $R_s$ from the target object. If the transmitter and the receiver are at the same location, the power denisty with $R_s = R$ at the receiver is

$$
  S_s = \frac{P_\text{tx} G_\text{tx}}{(4\pi R^2)^2} \sigma_\text{rcs}
$$

The waves with this power density are received by the receive antenna. With the effective antenna are $A_\text{e}$, the following applies to the received power $P_\text{rx}$

$$
  P_\text{tx} = A_\text{e, rx} S_s
$$

Adding the gain of the receive antenna

$$
  G_\text{rx} = \frac{4\pi A_\text{e, rx}}{\lambda^2}
$$

the receive power becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
  P_\text{rx} = P_\text{tx} \frac{G_\text{tx} G_\text{rx} \lambda^2}{(4\pi)^3 R^4} \sigma_\text{rcs}
\tag{\label{equation-2}}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation is known as the radar equation for point targets. The minimum received power $P_\text{rx, min}$ that can still be processed is often known for radar sensors. This allows for the maximum range $R_\text{max}$ of a radar to be calculateada for a given transmit power

$$
  R_\text{max} = \sqrt[4]{P_\text{tx} \frac{G_\text{tx} G_\text{rx} \lambda^2}{(4\pi)^3 P_\text{rx, min}}}
$$

As can be seen, the receive power of a radar sensor decreases with the fourth power of the range $R$ between the target and the sensor. Doubling the range leads to a reduction in receive power by a factor of $16$. This is due to the two spherical wave, which propagate between the transmitter and the target with $1/R^2$ each and a product in $\eqref{equation-2}$ ultimately lead to $1/R^4$. The resulting strong attenuation of the signal in the channel between the radar sensor and the target means that a radar sensor must be able to process very weak signals. If very different ranges occur in an application, the radar channel is highly dynamic. The dynamics of the radar channel is the ratio of the maximum received power from targets at close range to the minimum received power for targets at maximum range.
