# Terminology

- **Examples:** Items or instances of data used for learning or evaluation.
- **Features:** The set of attributes, often represented as a tensor, associated to an example.
- **Labels:** Values or categories assigned to examples.
- **Training sample:** Examples used to train a learning algorithm.
- **Validation sample:** Examples used tune the parameters of a learning algorithm when working with labeled data.
- **Test sample:** Examples used to evaluate the performance of a learning algorithm that are separate from the training and validation samples.
- **Loss function:** A function measuring the difference, or loss, between a predicted label and a true label. If $Y$ is the set of all labels and $Y'$ is the set of all possible predictions, the loss function is a mapping $L: Y \times Y' \to \R_+$. In most cases $Y' = Y$ and the loss function is bounded. Common example of loss functions are the zero-one (or misclassification) loss defined over $\Set{-1,1} \times \Set{-1,1}$ by $L(y, y') = \mathbf{1}_{y' = \neq y}$ and the squared loss defined over $I\times I$ by $L(y, y') = (y' - y)^2$, where $I\subseteq\R$ is typically a bounded interval.
- **Hypothesis set:** A set of functions mapping features to the set of labels.

Machine learning techniques can be divided into three categories:
- **Supervised learning:** The learner receives a set of labeled examples as training data and makes predictions for all unseen points.
    - Classification (discrete)
    - Regression (continuous)
- **Unsupervised learning:** The learner exclusively receives unlabeled training data and makes predictions for all unseen points. 
    - Clustering
- **Semi-supervised learning:** The learner receives a training sample consisting of both labeled and unlabed data, and makes predictions for all unseen points.
- **Transductive inference:** The learner receives a labeled training sample along with a set of unlabeled test points and makes predicition only these particular test points.
- **On-line learning:** Learning is conducted over multiple rounds with intermixed training and testing phases. At each round, the learner receives an unlabeled training point, makes a prediction, receives the true label, and incurs a loss. The objective is to minimize the cumulative loss over all rounds. No distributional assumption is made; instances and their labels may be chosen adversarially.
- **Reinforcement learning:** To collect information, the learner actively interacts with the environment and in some cases affects the environment, and receives an immediate reward for each action. The goal is to maximize the reward over a course of actions and iterations with the environment. However, no long-term reward feedback is provided by the environment, and the learner is faced with the *exploration versus exploitation* dilemma, since it must choose between exploring unknown actions to gain more information versus exploiting the information already collected.
- **Active learning:** The learner adaptively or interactively collects training examples, typically by quering an oracle to request labels for new points. The goal is to achieve a performance comparable to supervised learning.

# Supervised learning

With supervised learning the goal is to learn a mapping $f:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}$. The inputs $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{X}$ are
