# Topological space

Topological spaces are an abstraction of metric spaces. 

<MathBox title='Topological space' boxType='definition'>
Let $X$ be a set with power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$. A topology on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ of subsets of $X$, called open subsets, satisfying

1. $\emptyset, X \in \mathcal{T}$
2. $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under arbitrary union: $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}\implies\bigcup A \in \mathcal{T}$
3. $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under finite intersection: $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T} \land \mathcal{A}\text{ is finite } \implies \bigcap \mathcal{A} \in \mathcal{T}$

The pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called a topological space. A subset $C\subseteq X$ is called closed in $(X,\mathcal{T})$ if its complement is open, i.e. $X\setminus C \in\mathcal{T}$. Note that $X$ and $\emptyset$ are both open and closed.
</MathBox>

A topology can similarly be constructed from collections of closed sets, as captured in the following proposition.

<MathBox title='Closed set topology' boxType='proposition'>
Given a set $X$, then $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ is the collection of closed sets for a topology on $X$ if and only if

1. $\emptyset, X \in \mathcal{X}$
2. $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under arbitrary intersection: $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C}\implies\bigcap A \in \mathcal{C}$
3. $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under finite union: $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C} \land \mathcal{A}\textrm{ is finite } \implies \bigcup \mathcal{A} \in \mathcal{C}$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Note that $\mathcal{T} = \Set{U^c | U\in\mathcal{C}}$ defines a collection of open sets that satsify the axioms of a topology
1. since $\emptyset, X\in\mathcal{T}$ and $\emptyset = X^c$, then $\emptyset, X\in\mathcal{C}$
2. for an arbitrary collection $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$ we know that $\bigcup\mathcal{A}\in\mathcal{T}$. Taking the complement of the union and applying DeMorgan's law gives
$$
  \left( \bigcup\mathcal{A} \right)^c &= \bigcap \Set{ A^c | A\in\mathcal{A} } \in\mathcal{C}
$$
3. for an arbitrary collection $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, then $\bigcup\mathcal{A}\in\mathcal{T}$. Noting that $\mathcal{A}^c = \Set{A^c | A\in\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$. Applying DeMorgan's law shows that $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under arbitrary intersection
$$
  \left( \bigcup\mathcal{A} \right)^c = \bigcap \Set{ A^c | A\in\mathcal{A} } = \bigcap \mathcal{A}^c \in\mathcal{C}
$$
4. for a finite collection $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, then $\bigcap\mathcal{A}\in\mathcal{T}$. Noting that $\mathcal{A}^c = \Set{A^c | A\in\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$. Applying DeMorgan's law shows that $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under finite union
$$
  \left( \bigcap\mathcal{A} \right)^c = \bigcup \Set{ A^c | A\in\mathcal{A} } = \bigcup \mathcal{A}^c \in\mathcal{C}
$$

<MathBox title='Neighbourhood' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a point $x\in X$. A neighbourhood of $x$ is a subset $V\subseteq X$ that includes an open set $U\subseteq X$ containing $x$, i.e.

$$
  x \in U\subseteq V\subseteq X
$$

The neighbourhood $V$ need not be open.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space. A set $U\subseteq X$ is open if and only if $U$ is a neighbourhood of every $x\in U$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $U$ is open, then it is clearly a neighbourhood of every $x\in U$. Conversely, suppose $U$ is a neighbourhood of every $x\in U$. Then by definition, for every $x\in U$ there is an open set $\x \in U_x \subseteq U$. Then $\bigcup_{x\in U} U_x = U$ is also open.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Closure' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. The closure of $S$, denoted $\mathrm{cl}(S) \equiv \overline{S}$ is the intersection of all closed subsets of $X$ containing $S$

$$
  \overline{S} := \Set{\bigcap C \subseteq X | C\textrm{ is closed and }S\subseteq C }
$$

This is the smallest closed set containing $S$.
1. $\overline{S}$ is closed
2. $S\subseteq\overline{S}$
3. if $C$ is closed and $S\subseteq C$ then $\overline{S}\subseteq C$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Interior' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. Then $p\in S$ is called an interior point of $S$ if and only if there is an open set $U\in\mathcal{T}$ such that $p\in U$ and $U \subseteq S$. The interior of $S$, denoted $\mathrm{int}(S) \equiv S^0$, is the set of all interior points of $S$. Equivalently, $\mathrm{Int}(S)$, is defined as the union of all open subsets of $X$ contained in $S$.

$$
  \mathrm{int}(S) := \Set{\bigcup U\subseteq X | U\textrm{ is open and }U\subseteq S }
$$

This set is the largest open subset of $S$:
1. $\mathrm{int}(S)$ is open
2. $\mathrm{int}(S)\subseteq S$
3. if $U$ is open and $U\subseteq S$, then $U\subseteq\mathrm{int}(S)$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Exterior' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. Then $p\in S$ is called an extorior point of $S$ if and only if there is an open set $U \in \mathcal{T}$ such that $p \in U$ and $U \subseteq X\setminus S$. The extorior of $S$, denoted $\mathrm{ext}(S)$, is the set of all extorior points of $S$. Equivalently, $\mathrm{ext}(S)$ is the is the union of all open subsets of $X$ contained in $X \setminus S$, i.e. disjoint from $S$.

$$
  \mathrm{ext}(S) := \Set{\bigcup U\subseteq X | U\textrm{ is open and }U\subseteq X\setminus S }
$$

This is the largest open set disjoint from $S$. The exterior is the interior of of the complement of $S$

$$
  \mathrm{ext}(S) = \mathrm{int}(X\setminus S) = X\setminus\overline{S}
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Boundary' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. Then $p\in S$ is called a boundary point of $S$ if and only if for all open sets $U \in \mathcal{T}$ with $p \in U$ then $U \cap S \neq \emptyset$ and $U \cap (X\setminus S) \neq \emptyset$. The boundary of $S$, denoted $\partial S$, is the set off all boundary points of $S$. Equivalently

$$
  \partial S := \overline{S}\setminus\mathrm{int}(S)
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Derived set' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. Then $p\in S$ is an accumulation point of $S$ if and only if for all open sets $U \in \mathcal{T}$ with $p \in U$ then $U\setminus \Set{ p } \cap S \neq \emptyset$. The derived set of $S$, denoted $S'$, is the set of all accumulation points of $S$.
</MathBox>

## Partial order

<MathBox title='Topological partial order' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $X$ is a set, and that $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are topologies on $X$. If $\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{T}$ is finer than $\mathcal{S}$, and $\mathcal{S}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}$. *Coarser than* ($\subseteq$) defines a partial order on the collection of topologies on $X$. That is, if $\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{T}$ are topologies on $X$, then this partial order has the following properties
1. reflexivity: $\mathcal{R}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{R}$
2. anti-symmetry: if $\mathcal{R}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{S}$, and $\mathcal{S}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{R}$, then $\mathcal{R} = \mathcal{S}$
3. transitivity: if $\mathcal{R}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ is coarser that $\mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{R}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}$
</MathBox>

## Separation

Separation properties refer to the ability to separate points or sets with disjoint open sets. Separated spaces are known as Hausdorff spaces.

<MathBox title='Hausdorff space (separated space)' boxType='definition'>
A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called a Hausdorff space if for every pair of distinct points $p, q \in X$, there exist disjoint open subsets $U, V \subseteq X$, ie. $U \cap V = \emptyset$ such that $p \in U$ and $q \in V$. A Hausdorff space guarantees the uniqueness of limits of sequences.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Regular space' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A closed set $A\subseteq X$ and a point $x\in A^c$ can be separated if there exist disjoint open sets $U, V\in\mathcal{T}$ with $A\subseteq U$ and $x\in V$. If every nonempty closed set $A$ and point $x\in A^c$ can be separated, then $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called a regular space. 
</MathBox>

## Basis

<MathBox title='Base' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A collection of open subsets $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$ is called a basis (base) of $\mathcal{T}$ if every set in $\mathcal{T}$ can be written as a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$

$$
  \forall T\in\mathcal{T}: \bigcup_{i \in I} B_i \subseteq\mathcal{B} = T
$$

where $I$ is an index set.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Base properties' boxType='proposition'>
Let $X$ be a nonempty set. A collection of open subsets $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a base for a topology on $X$ if and only if
1. $X = \bigcup\mathcal{B}$
2. if $A,B\in\mathcal{B}$ and $x\in A\cap B$, there exists $C\in\mathcal{B}$ with $x\in C\subseteq A\cap B$

The second condition can be more weakly stated as
2. if $A, B\in\mathcal{B}$, then $A\cap B\in\mathcal{B}$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $\mathcal{B}$ is a base for a topology on $X$. Since $X$ is open, $X$ is a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$. Since every set in $\mathcal{B}$ is a subset of $X$, we must have $X=\bigcup\mathcal{B}$. Suppose that $A,B\in\mathcal{B}$ and that $x\in A\cap B$. Since $A\cap B$ is open, it's a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$. The point $x$ must be in one of those sets, so there exists $C\in\mathcal{B}$ with $x\in C\subseteq A\cap B$.
</details>
</MathBox>

A neighbourhood basis at $p \in X$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}_p$ of neighbourhoods of $p$ such that every neighbourhood of $p$ contains at least one $B \in \mathcal{B}_p$.

A topological set $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is first-countable if there is a countable neighbourhood basis at each point, and second-countable if there is a countable basis of $\mathcal{T}$. Since a countable basis of $\mathcal{T}$ contains a countable neighbourhood basis at each point, second-countability implies first-countability. A set is called countable if it admits a bijection with the set of natural numbers.

### Examples

For a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ induced by a metric $(X, d)$, the basis of $\mathcal{T}$ is

$$
  \mathcal{B} = \Set{ B_\varepsilon (x) | x \in X, \, \varepsilon > 0 }
$$

## Compactness (finite covers)

<MathBox title='Cover' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A cover of $X$ is a collection of subsets $\mathcal{C} = \Set{ U_i }_{i\in I}$, for some index set $I$, whose union is the whole space $X$, i.E

$$
  \bigcup \mathcal{C} = \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i = X
$$

The collection $\mathcal{C}$ is said to cover a subspace $A\subseteq X$ if

$$
  A \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{C} = \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i
$$

We call $\mathcal{C}$ an open cover if all its members are open subsets, i.e. $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, and we call $\mathcal{C}$ a closed cover if all its members are closed subsets. A subcover of $\mathcal{C}$ is a subset of $\mathcal{C}$ that still covers $X$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Compact set' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A subset $C\subseteq X$ is called compact if any open cover of $C$ has a finite subcover. That is, if $\mathcal{A}\in\mathcal{T}$ covers $C$, i.e. with $C\subseteq\bigcap\mathcal{A}$, there exists a finite $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{A}$ with $C\subseteq\mathcal{B}$. Alternatively, any infinite collection of open sets that together cover a compact set, always overcovers it. A topological space $X$ is locally compact if every point $x\in X$ has a compact neighbourhood.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proposition' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $C\subseteq X$ be compact. If $B\subseteq C$ is closed, then $B$ is also compact.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $\mathcal{A}$ is an open cover of $B$. Since $B$ is closed, then $B^c$ is open, so $\mathcal{A}\cup \Set{B^c}$ is an open cover of $C$. Since $C$ is compact, this last collection has a finite subcover of $C$, which is also a finite subscover of $B$. Hence $B$ is also compact.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Compactness is preserved under finite unions' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $C_i \subseteq X$ be compact for each $i$ in a finite index set $I$. Then $C = \bigcup_{i\in I} C_i$ is compact.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $\mathcal{A}$ is an open cover of $C$. Trivially, $\mathcal{A}$ is also an open cover of $C_i$ for each $i\in I$. Hence there exists a finite subcover $\mathcal{A}_i \subseteq\mathcal{A}$ of $C_i$ for each $i\in I$. Then $\bigcup_{i\in I} \mathcal{A}_i$ is also a finite cover of $C$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Compactness properties of Hausdorff spaces' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a Hausdorff space, then the following properties hold
1. if $C\subseteq X$ is compact, then $C$ is closed, ie. $C^c = X \setminus C \in \mathcal{T}$
2. if $x\in X$, $C\subseteq X$ is compact, and $x\notin C$, then there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ with $x\in U$ and $C\subseteq V$
3. if $x\in X$ and $A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ with $\partial A$ compact, then there exists a closed neighbourhood $B$ of $x$ with $B\subseteq A$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** We will show that $C^c = X\setminus C$ is open, so fix $x\in C^c$. Since $C$ is Hausdorff, each $y\in C$ can be separated from $x$, meaning there are disjoint open sets $U_y, V_y\in\mathcal{T}$ with $x\in U_y$ and $y\in V_y$. Trivially, the collection $\Set{ V_y | y\in C}$ form an open cover of $C$

$$
  C \subseteq \bigcup_{y \in C} V_y
$$

Since $C$ is compact, it has a finite subscover and hence there is a finite subset $B\subseteq C$ such that $\Set{ V_y | y\in B }$ covers $C$. But then $U = \bigcap_{y\in B} U_y$ is open (since $B$ is finite) and disjoint from $\bigcup_{y\in B} V_y$. Thus, $U$ is also disjoint from $C$. To summarize, $U$ is open and $x\in U\subseteq C^c$

**(2):** For each $y\in C$ there exist disjoint open sets $U_y$ and $V_y$ with $x\in U_y$ and $y\in V_y$. Trivially, the collection $\Set{V_y | y\in C}$ is an open cover of $C$, and by compactness there exists a finite subset $B\subseteq C$ such that $\Set{V_y | y\in B}$ covers $C$. Thus, let $U = \bigcap_{y\in B} U_y$ and $V = \bigcup_{y\in B} V_y$. Then $U$ is open, since $B$ is finite, and $V$ is open. Moreover $U$ and $V$ are disjoint, and $x\in U$ and $C\subseteq V$.

**(3):** By property $(2)$, there exists disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ with $x\in U$ and $\partial A\subseteq V$. Hence $\overline{U}$ and $\partial A$ are disjoint. Let $B = \overline{A\cap U}$. Note that $B$ is closed, and is a neighbourhood of $x$ since $U$ and $A$ are neighbourhoods of $x$. Moreover

$$
\begin{align*}
  B &\subseteq \overline{A}\cap\overline{U} \\
  &= [A\cup \partial A]\cap\overline{U} \\
  &= [A\cap\overline{U}] \cup \underbrace{[\partial A \cap\overline{U}]}_{=\emptyset} \\
  &= A\cap\overline{U} \subseteq A
\end{align*}
$$
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Compactness properties of Hausdorff spaces' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. If $x\in X$ and $A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, then there exists a compact neighbourhood $B$ of $x$ with $B\subseteq A$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Since $X$ is locally compact, there exists a compact neighbourhood $C$ of $x$. Hence $A\cap C$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Moreover, $\partial(A\cap C)\subseteq C$ is closed and hence compact. We know that there exists a closed neighbourhood $B$ of $x$ with $B\subseteq A\cap C$. Since $B$ is closed and $B\subseteq C$, it is also compact. Additionally we have $B\subseteq A$.  
</details>
</MathBox>

## Connectivity

<MathBox title='Connected and disconnected spaces' boxType='definition'>
A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is disconnected if there exists two disjoint nonempty open subsets $A, B \subseteq X$ such that $X = A \cup B$ and $\overline{A}\cap B = A \cap \overline{B} = \emptyset$. Otherwise $X$ is connected, which is equivalently true if and only if the only subsets of $X$ that are both open and closed are $\emptyset$ and $X$ itself.
</MathBox>

A connected subset of $X$ is a subset that is connected space when endowed with the subspace topology. A maximal connected subset of $X$ (that is not containing in any larger connected subset) is called a (connected) component of $X$. 

<MathBox title='Path-connected spaces' boxType='definition'>
A path in $X$ from $p \in X$ to $q \in X$ is a continuous map $f: I = [0, 1] \to X$ such that $f(0) = p$ and $f(1) = q$. If there exists a path in $X$ for every pair $p, q \in X$, then $X$ is path-connected. The path components of $X$ are its maximal path-connected subsets.

The topological space $X$ is locally path-connected if $X$ has a basis of path-connected open subsets.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of (path-)connected spaces' boxType='definition'>
Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces.
1. If $F:X \to Y$ is continuous and $X$ is connected, then $F(X)$ is also connected.
2. Every connected subset of $X$ is contained in a single component of $X$.
3. A union of connected subspaces of $X$ with a point in common is connected.
4. The components of $X$ are disjoint nonempty closed subsets whose union is $X$, and thus they form a partition of $X$.
5. If $S \subseteq X$ is both open and closed, then $S$ is a union of components of $X$.
6. Every finite product of connected spaces is connected.
7. Every quotient space of a connected space is connected.
</MathBox>

A topological space is locally path-connected if it admits a basis of path-connected open subsets.

<MathBox title='Properties of locally path-connected spaces' boxType='definition'>
Let $X$ be a topological space.
1. The components of $X$ are open in $X$.
2. The path components of $X$ are equal to its components.
3. $X$ is connected if and only if it is path-connected.
4. Every open subset of $X$ is locally path-connected.
</MathBox>

## Countability axioms

<MathBox title='Dense set' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space. A set $D\subseteq X$ is dense if $U\subseteq D$ is nonempty for every nonempty $U\subseteq\mathcal{T}$. Equivalently, $D$ is dense if every neighbourhood of a point $x\in X$ contains an element of $D$. A set $S$ is said to be nowhere dense in $X$ if $\overline{S}$ contains no nonempty open subset.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proposition' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space. A set $D\subseteq X$ is dense if and only if $\overline{D} = X$
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $D$ is dense. Since $\overline{D}$ is closed, then $\overline{D}^c$ is open. If this set is nonempty, it must contain a point in $D$. This is a constradiction since $D\subseteq\overline{D}$. Conversely, suppose that $\overline{D} = X$, and suppose that $U$ is a nonempty open set. Then $U^c$ is closed and $U^c \neq X$. If $D\cap U = \emptyset$, then $D\subseteq U^c$. But then $\overline{D}\subseteq U^c$ so $\overline{D}\neq X$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Countability axioms' boxType='axiom'>
A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is called
1. *separable* if there exists a countable dense subset
2. *first-countable* if each point $x\in X$ has a countable neighbourhood basis
3. *second-countable* if the topology $\mathcal{T}$ has a countable base
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Countability relations' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X,\mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, then the following properties hold
1. if $X$ is second countable, then it is separable
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Suppose that $\mathcal{B} = \Set{U_i}_{i\in I}$ is a base for $\mathcal{T}$, where $I$ is a countable index set. Select $x_i\in U_i$ for each $i\in I$, and let $D = \Set{ x_i }_{i\in I}$, which is clearly countable. If $U$ is open and nonempty, then $U = \bigcup_{j\in J} U_j$ for some $J\subseteq I$. But then $\Set{x_j }_{j\in J} \subseteq U$, so $D$ is dense.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $X$ be a second-countable topological space. Every open cover of $X$ has a countable subcover.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a countable basis for $X$, and let $\mathcal{U}$ be an arbitrary open cover of $X$. Let $\mathcal{B}' \subseteq\mathcal{B}$ be the collection of basis open subsets $B\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $B\subseteq U$ for some $U\in\mathcal{U}$. For each $B\in\mathcal{B}'$, choose a particular set $U_B \in\mathcal{U}$ containing $B$. The collection $\Set{U_B | B\in\mathcal{B}'}$ is countable, so it suffices to show that it covers $X$. Given a point $B\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B\subseteq V$. This implies, in particular, that $B\in\mathcal{B}'$ and therefore $x\in B\subseteq U_B$.
</details>
</MathBox>

## Convergence

<MathBox title='Convergent sequence' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A sequence $\left( x_n \in X \right)_{n \in \N}$ of points in $X$ is said to converge to a point $x\in X$, if and only if for each neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ there is a $N \in \N$ such that $x_n \in U$ for all $n \geq N$. This convergence is denoted $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} x$.
</MathBox>

Unlike metric spaces, where neighbourhoods can be made arbitrarily small, the limit of a sequence in a topological space is not necessarily unique. This is only the case if points in the space can be separated, meaning that the space is Hausdorff.

<MathBox title='Uniqueness of limits' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a Hausdorff space. If $\left( x_n \in X \right)_{n\in\N}$ is a sequence of points in $X$ with $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} x$ and $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} y$, then $x = y$.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $x\neq y$, there exists disjoint neighbourhoods $A$ and $B$ of $x$ and $y$, respectively. There exist $M, N \in\N$ such that $x_n \in A$ for all $n \geq M$ and $x_n \in B$ for all $n\geq N$. However, if $n \geq\max\Set{M, N}$, then $x_n \in A$ and $x_n \in B$, giving a contradiction.
</details>
</MathBox>

## Continuity

Continuity of functions is one of the most important concepts of topology. The idea is that if two points are close together in the domain, the functional values should be close together in the range. In topology, this is expressed through preservation of openness between the domain and range spaces. A continuous function has the property that the preimage of an open set (in the range space) is also open (in the domain space).

<MathBox title='Open function' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces. A map $f: X \to Y$ is called open if it sends open sets $A \subseteq X$ to open sets $f[A] \subseteq Y$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Continuous function' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces. A function $f: X\to Y$ is continuous if $f^{-1}[U]\in\mathcal{T}_X$ is open for every open $U \in\mathcal{T}_Y$. The function $f$ is locally continuous at a point $x\in X$ if $f^{-1}[B]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ whenever $B$ is a neighbourhood of $f(x)\in Y$. Given a subset $A\subseteq X$, the function $f$ is continuous on $A$ if $f$ is continuous at each $x\in A$.

If $f$ is bijective and $f^{-1}: Y \to X$ is continuous, then $f$ is also open. The continuity of $f^{-1}$ implies that for all open sets $A \subseteq X$, then $\left( f^{-1} \right)^{-1}[A] = f[A] \subseteq Y$ is also open.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proposition' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be two topoligical spaces. A function $f: X\to Y$ is continuous if and only if $f$ is continuous at each $x\in X$.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $f$ is continuous. Let $x\in X$ and let $B$ be a neighbourhood of $f(x)$. Then there exists an open set $V\subseteq T$ with $f(x)\in V\subseteq B$. However, then $f^{-1}[V]\in\mathcal{T}_X$ is open in $X$, and $x\in f^{-1}[V]\subseteq f^{-1}[B]$, so $f^{-1}[B]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Hence $f$ is continuous at $x$.

Conversely, suppose that $f$ is continuous at each $x\in X$, and suppose that $V\in\mathcal{T}_Y$. If $V$ contains no points in the range of $f$, then $f^{-1}[V] = \emptyset\in\mathcal{T}_X$. Otherwise, there exists $x\in X$ with $f(x)\in V$. However, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of $f(x)$, so $U = f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Let $y\in U$. Then $f(y)\in V$ also, so $U$ is also a neighbourhood of $y$, hence $U\in\mathcal{T}$.

<MathBox title='Continuity preserves limits' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be two topoligical spaces, and consider a continuous function $f: X\to Y$. If $\left( x_n \in X \right)_{n\in\N}$ is a sequence of points in $X$ with $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} x$, then $f(x_n) \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} f(x)$.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $V\subseteq Y$ with $f(x)\in V$. Then $f^{-1}[V]$ is open in $X$ and $x\in f^{-1}[V]$. Hence there exists $N\in\N$ such that $x_n \in f^{-1}[V]$ for every $n\geq M$. However, then $f(x_n)\in V$ for every $n\geq N$ meaning $f(x_n) \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} f(x)$.

<MathBox title='Composition preserves continuity' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$, $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ and $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$ be three topoligical spaces. If $f: X\to Y$ and $g: Y\to Z$ are continuous, then $g\circ f: X\to Z$ is continuous.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $A$ is open in $Z$, then $g^{-1}[A]$ is open in $Y$ and therefore $f^{-1}\left[g^{-1}[A] \right] = \left(f^{-1}\circ g^{-1} \right)(A)$ is open in $X$. Noting $(g\circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}$.

<MathBox title='Continuity is local' boxType='lemma'>
Continuity is a local property in the following sense: if $F:X\to Y$ is a map between topological spaces such that every point $p\in X$ has a neighbourhood $U$ on which the restriction $F|_U$ is continuous, then $F$ is continuous.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Gluing lemma for continuous maps' boxType='lemma'>
Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, and suppose that one of the following conditions holds:
1. $B_1,\dots,B_n$ are finitely many closed subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$
2. $\Set{B_i}_{i\in A}$ is a collection of open subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$

Suppose that for all $i$ we are given continuous maps $F_i:B_i\to Y$ that agree on overlaps, i.e. $F_i|_{B_i \cap B_j} = F_j|_{B_i \cap B_j}$. Then there exists a unique continuous map $F:X\to Y$ whose restriction to each $B_i$ is equal to $F_i$. 
</MathBox>

### Homeomorphism

<MathBox title='Homeomorphism' boxType='definition'>
Given two topological spaces $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$, a continuous bijection $f: X \mapsto Y$ with a continuous inverse is called a homeomorphism. When such a function exists, the topoligical spaces $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic. A continuous map is called a local homeomorphism if every point $p \in X$ has a neighbourhood $U \subseteq X$ such that $f(U)$ is open in $Y$ and $f$ restricts to a homeomorphism from $U$ to $f(U)$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of homeomorphisms' boxType='proposition'>
For topological spaces $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$, $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ and $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$, then
1. $X$ is homeomorphic to $X$ (reflexivity)
2. if $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$, then $Y$ is homeomorphic to $X$ (symmetry)
3. if $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$, and $Y$ is homeomorphic to $Z$, then $X$ is homeomorphic to $Z$ (transitivity)
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

1. The identity function $\mathrm{id}: X\to X$ defined by $\mathrm{id}(x) = x$ for $x\in S$ is a homeomorphism from $S$ to itself.
2. If $f: X\to Y$ is a homeomorphism from $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ to $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$, then $f$ is continuous bijection and hence $f^{-1}: Y\to X$ is a homeomorphism from $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ to $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$.
3. If $f: X\to Y$ is a homeomorphism from $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ to $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$, and $g: Y\to Z$ is homeomorphism from $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ to $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$, then $g\circ f: X\to Z$ is homemorphism from $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ to $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$.

</MathBox>

### Sequential continuity

A map $f: X \mapsto Y$ is called sequential continuous if for all $x \in X$ such that $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \N}$ with $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} x$, then $\left( f(x_n) \right)_{n \in \mathcal{N}} \subseteq Y$ is convergent with $f(x_n) \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} f(x)$.

## Subspace

A subspace of the topological space $(X, \mathcal{U})$ is a subset $A \subseteq X$ with the topology given by $\Set{ A \cap U | U \in \mathcal{U} }$

## Product topology

<MathBox title='Product topology' boxType='definition'>
Let $\Set{ \left(X_i, \mathcal{T}_{i}\right) }_{i\in I}$ be a collection of topological spaces, where $I$ is an index set. The product space denoted $\prod_{i\in I} (X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)$ consists of the product space $\prod_{i\in I} X_i$ with a topology given by the basis

$$
  \mathcal{B} := \Set{ \prod_{i\in I} U_i | U_i \in\mathcal{T}_i \textrm{ and }U_i = X_i \textrm{ for all but a finite number of }i\in I }
$$
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Trivially, $\prod_{i\in I} X_i = \bigcup\mathcal{B}$. Given $\prod_{i\in I} A_i \in\mathcal{B}$, $\prod_{i\in I} B_i \in\mathcal{B}$, then 

$$
  \left($\prod_{i\in I} A_i \in\mathcal{B}$\right) \cap \left( $\prod_{i\in I} B_i \in\mathcal{B}$ \right) = \prod_{i, j \in I} A_i \cap B_j \in\mathcal{B}
$$

Hence, $\mathcal{B}$ is a well defined base for the product topology.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Projections are continuous' boxType='proposition'>
Let $\prod_{i\in I} (X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)$ be a product space. The projections $p_j : \prod_{i\in I} (X_i,\mathcal{T}_i)\to X_j$ defined by $p_j (x) = x_j$ are continuous functions.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $U$ is open in $X_j$, then $p_j^{-1}[U] = \prod_{i\in I} A_i$ where $A_i = X_i$ for $i\in I$ with $i\neq j$ and $A_j = U$, so this preimage is open in the product space.
</details>
</MathBox>

## Quotient space

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and consider an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $X$. The quotient space wrt to the equivalence relation is the set $X/{\sim}$ with the quotient topology.

An equivalence on the set $X$ is a subset $E$ of the set $X \times X = \Set{ \left( x_1, x_2 \right) | x_1, x_2 \in X }$ satisfying

1. reflexivity: $\left( x, x \right) \in E \, \forall x \in E$ or $x \sim x$
2. symmetry: $\left( x, y \right) \in E \Rightarrow \left( y, x \right)$ or $x \sim y \implies y \sim x$
3. transivity: If $\left( x, y \right) \in E$ and $\left( y, z \right) \in E$ then $\left( x, z \right) \in E$, or $x \sim y \wedge y \sim x \implies x \sim z$

If $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $X$, then for each $x \in X$, the equivalence class of $x$ is defined as the subset 

$$
  [x]_\sim := \Set{ y \in X | x \sim y }
$$

The set of all equivalence classes is a partition of $X$ into a collection of nonempty, mutually disjoint subsets, defined as 

$$
  X /{\sim} := \Set{ [x]_\sim | x \in X }
$$

Given the surjective quotient map $p: X \mapsto X /{\sim}$ with $x \mapsto [x]_\sim$, commonly known as a canonical projection. The quotient topology $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ on $X / \sim$ is defined by declaring a subset $U \subseteq X /{\sim}$ to be open if and only if $p^{-1}[U] \subset X$ is open, ie.

$$
  p^{-1} [U] \in \mathcal{T} \iff U \in \hat{\mathcal{T}}
$$

### Projective space

A projective space $P^n (\R)$ is the set  of 1-dimensional subspaces of $\R^{n+1}$. It is defined as the quotient space $P^n := S^n / \sim$ with the equivalence relation $x \sim y :\iff (x = y \textrm{ or } x = -y)$ and where 

$$
  S^n := \Set{ x \in \R^{n+1} \,|\, \| x \| = 1 }
$$

is the $n$-dimensional sphere. To show that $P^n (\R)$ is a Hausdorff space we consider $[x]_\sim , [y]_\sim \in P^n (\R)$ with $[x]_\sim \neq [y]_\sim$. We then take the open neighbourhoods $U, V \in S^n$ of $x$ and $y$ respectively with

$$
\begin{aligned}
  U \cap V &= \emptyset \\
  -U \cap -V &= \emptyset 
\end{aligned}\quad
\begin{aligned}
  -U \cap V &= \emptyset \\
  U \cap -V &= \emptyset 
\end{aligned}
$$

Considering $\hat{U}:= q[u]$ where $q: S^n \mapsto S^n / \sim$ is the canonical projection. Taking the preimage we see that 

$$
  q^{-1}\left[\hat{U}\right] = U \cup -U \in \mathcal{T} \implies \hat{U} \in \hat{\mathcal{T}}
$$

hence, $\hat{U}$ is open. In the same manner it can be shown that $\hat{V}:= q[v] \in \hat{\mathcal{T}}$ is open. We can now show that

$$
  q^{-1}\left[ \hat{U} \cap \hat{V} \right] = q^{-1}\left[\hat{U}\right] \cap q^{-1}\left[\hat{V}\right] = (U \cup -U) \cap (V \cup -V) = \emptyset
$$

since $q$ is surjective we conclude that $\hat{U} \cap \hat{V} = \emptyset$ which proves that $P^n (\R)$ is a Hausdorff space.

### Möbius strip

The Möbius strip can be defined as the square $X = [0, 1] \times (-1,1) \in \R \times \R$ with the equivalence relation $(0, s) \sim (1, -s) \implies x \neq \pm y$.

## Covering maps

<MathBox title='Covering map' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $E$ and $X$ are topological spaces. A map $\pi:E\to X$ is called a *covering map* if $E$ and $X$ are connected and locally path-connevted, $\pi$ is surjective and continuous, and each point $\mathbf{p}\in X$ has a neighbourhood $U$ that is *evenly covered* by $\pi$, meaning that each component of $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is mapped homemorphically onto $U$ by $\pi$. In this case, $X$ is called the *base of covering*, and $E$ is called a *covering space* of $X$. If $U$ is an evenly covered subset of $X$, the components of $\pi^{-1}(U)$ are called the *sheets of the covering* over $U$. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Lift' boxType='definition'>
If $\pi:E \to X$ is a covering map and $F:B\to X$ is a continuous map, a *lift* of $F$ is a continuous map $\tilde{F}:B\to E$ such that $\pi\circ\tilde{F} = F$

$$
\begin{CD}
  B @>{\tilde{F}}>> E \\
  @| @VV{\pi}V \\
  B @>>{F}> X
\end{CD}
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Lifting properties of covering maps' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $\pi:E\to X$ is a covering map.
1. **(Unique lifting propery):** If $B$ is a connected space and $F:B\to X$ is a continuous map, then any two lifts of $F$ that agree at one point are identical.
2. **(Path lifting property):** If $f:I\to X$ is a path, then for any point $e\in E$ such that $\pi(\mathbf{e}) = f(0)$, there exists a unique lift $\tilde{f}_\mathbf{e}: I\to E$ of $f$ such that $\tilde{f}(0) = \mathbf{e}$.
3. **(Monodromy theorem):** If $f,g: I\to X$ are path-homotopic paths and $\tilde{f}_\mathbf{e}, \tilde{g}_e: I\to E$ are their lifts starting at the same point $\mathbf{e}\in E$, then $\tilde{f}_\mathbf{e}$ and $\tilde{g}_\mathbf{e}$ are path-homotopic and $\tilde{f}_\mathbf{e}(1) = \tilde{g}_\mathbf{e}(1)$.   
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Lifting criterion' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $\pi:E\to X$ is a covering map, $Y$ is a connected and locally path-connected space, and $F:Y\to X$ is a continuous map. Let $\mathbf{y}\in Y$ and $\mathbf{e}\in E$ be such that $\pi(\mathbf{e}) = F(\mathbf{y})$. Then there exists a lift $\tilde{F}: Y\to E$ of $F$ satisfying $\tilde{F}(\mathbf{y}) = \mathbf{e}$ if and only if $F_*(\pi_1(Y,\mathbf{y})) \subseteq \pi_* (\pi_1(E,\mathbf{e}))$. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Coverings of simply connected spaces' boxType='proposition'>
If $X$ is a simply connected space, then every covering map $\pi:E\to X$ is a homemorphism. A topological space is called *locally simply connected* if it admits a basis of simply connected open subsets.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proposition of a universal covering space' boxType='proposition'>
If $X$ is a connected and locally simply connected topologica space, there exists a simply connected topological space $\tilde{X}$ and a covering map $\pi:\tilde{X}\to X$. If $\hat{\pi}:\hat{X}\to X$ is any other simply connected covering of $X$, there is a homeomorphism $\varphi:\tilde{X}\to\hat{X}$ such that $\hat{\pi}\circ\varphi = \pi$. In this case $\tilde{X}$ is called the *universal covering space* of $X$.
</MathBox>

## Locally compact Hausdorff spaces

<MathBox title='Local compactness' boxType='definition'>
A topological space $X$ is *locally compact* if every point has a neighbourhood contained in a compact subset of $X$. A subset of $X$ is *precompact* in $X$ if its closure in $X$ is compact.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proper maps are closed' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $X$ is a topological space and that $Y$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space. Then every proper continuous map $F:X\to Y$ is closed.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $K\subseteq X$ be a closed subset. To show that $F(K)$ is closed in $Y$, we show that it contains all of its limit points. Let $\mathbf{y}$ be a limit point of $F(K)$ and let $U$ a precompact neighbourhood of $\mathbf{y}$. Then $\mathbf{y}$ is also a limit point of $F(K) \cap \overline{U}$. Bacause $F$ is proper, $F^{-1}(\overline{U})$ is compact, which implies that $K \cap F^{-1}(\overline{U})$ is compact. Because $F$ is continuous, $F(K \cap F^{-1}(\overline{U})) = F(K) \cap \overline{U}$ is compact and therefore closed in $Y$. In particular, $\mathbf{y}\in F(K) \cap \overline{U} \subseteq F(K)$, so $F(K)$ is closed.

<MathBox title='Baire cateogory theorem' boxType='theorem'>
In a locally compact Hausdorff space or a complete metric space, every countable union of nowhere dense sets has empty interior.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='corollary'>
In a locally compact Hausdorff space or a complete metric space, every nonempty countable closed subset contains at least one isolated point.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Assume that $X$ is such a space. Let $A\subseteq X$ be nonempty countable closed subset, and assume that $A$ has no isolated points. The fact that $A$ is closed in $X$ means that $A$ itself is either a locally compact Hausdorff space or a complete metric space. For each $\mathbf{a}\in A$, the singleton $\Set{\mathbf{a}}$ is nowhere dense in $A$: it is closed in $A$ because $A$ is Hausdorff, and it contains no nonempty open subsets because $A$ has no isolated points. Since $A$ is a countable union of singletons, the Baire category theorem implies that $A$ has empty interior in $A$, which is a contradiction.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='corollary'>
A second-countable, locally compact Hausdorff space admits an exhaustion by compact sets.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Assume that $X$ is such a space. Because $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space, it has a basis of precompact open subsets, since it is second-countable, it is covered by countably many such sets. Let $(U_i)_{i=1}^\infty$ be such a countable cover. Beginning with $K_1 = \overline{U}_1$, assume by induction that we have constructed compact sets $K_1,\dots,K_k$ satisfying $U_j \subseteq K_j$ for each $j$ and $K_{j-1}\subseteq \mathrm{int}(K_j)$ for $j \geq 2$. Because $K_k$ is compact, there is some $m_k$ such that $K_k \subseteq U_1 \cup\cdots\cup U_{m_k}$. If we let $K_{k+1} = \overline{U}_1 \cup\cdots\cup \overline{U}_{m_k}$, then $K_{k+1}$ is a compact set whose interior contains $K_k$. By inncreasing $m_k$ if necessary, we may assume that $m_k \geq k+1$, so that $U_{k+1} \subseteq K_{k+1}$. By induction, we obtain the required exhaustion.
</details>
</MathBox>

## Metrizable spaces

<MathBox title='Projections are continuous' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. If there exists a metric $d$ on $X$ such that $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_d$, i.e. the topology induced by $d$, then $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called metrizable.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Equivalence of metrics' boxType='definition'>
Let $X$ be a set. Metrics $d$ and $e$ on $X$ are equivalent, denoted $d\equiv e$ if $\mathcal{T}_d = \mathcal{T}_e$. The relation $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation on the collection of metrics on $X$ satisfying (for metrics $d,e,f$ on $X$):
1. reflexivity: $d\equiv d$
2. symmetry: $d\equiv e \implies e\equiv d$
3. transitivity: $d\equiv e \land e\equiv f \implies d\equiv f$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Partial order of metrics' boxType='proposition'>
Let $X$ be a set with metrics $d$ and $e$. Then $\mathcal{T}_e$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}_d$, i.e. $\mathcal{T}_d \subseteq \mathcal{T}_e$, if and only if every open ball relative to $d$ contains an open ball relative to $e$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $\mathcal{T}_d \subseteq \mathcal{T}_e$, i.e. $\mathcal{T}_e$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}_d$. For each $x\in X$ and $a > 0$, the open ball $B_d(x, a)$ at $x$ is in $\mathcal{T}_d$ and hence also in $\mathcal{T}_e$. Thus, there exists $b > 0$ such that $B_e(x, b)\subseteq B_d(x, a)$. Conversely, suppose that every open ball relative to $d$ contains an open ball relative to $e$. Consider an arbitrary open set $U\in\mathcal{T}_d$. For each $x\in U$, there is $a > 0$ such that $B_d(x, a)\subseteq U$. Thus, there is $b > 0$ such that $B_e(x, b)\subseteq B_d(x, e)\subseteq U$. Hence $U\in\mathcal{T}_e$ showing that $\mathcal{T}_d\subseteq\mathcal{T}_e$
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Urysohn metrization theorem' boxType='theorem'>
A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is metrizable if it is a regular, second-countable, Hausdorff space.
</MathBox>

## Homotopy

<MathBox title='Homotopy' boxType='definition'>
If $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces and $F_0,F_1:X\to Y$ are continuous maps, a *homotopy* from $F_0$ to $F_1$ is a continuous map $H:X\times I\subseteq \R \to Y$ satisfying for all $x\in X$

$$
\begin{align*}
  H(x,0) =& F_0(x) \\
  H(x,1) =& F_1(x)
\end{align*}
$$

If there exists a homotopy from $F_0$ to $F_1$, we say that $F_0$ and $F_1$ are *homotopic*, denoted $F_0 \simeq F_1$. If the homotopy satisfies $H(x,t) = F_0(x) = F_1(x)$ for all $t\in I$ and all $x$ in some subset $X\subseteq A$, the maps $F_0$ and $F_1$ are said to be homotopic relative to $A$. Both "homotopic" and "homotopic relative to $A$" are equivalence relations on the set of all continuous maps from $X$ to $Y$.
</MathBox>

# Topological manifolds

<MathBox title='Topological manifold' boxType='definition'>
A topological space $M$ is a topological manifold of dimension $n\in\N_+$ if it has the following properties:
1. $M$ is a *Hausdorff space*: for every pair of distinct points $p,q\in M$ there are disjoint subsets $U, V\subseteq M$ such that $p\in U$ and $q \in V$.
2. $M$ is *second-countable*: there exists a countable basis for the topology of $M$.
3. $M$ is *locally Euclidean of dimension* $n$: each point of $M$ has a neighbourhood that is homemorphic to an open subset of $\R^n$.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

More specifically, the third property means that for each $p\in M$ we can find
- an open subset $U\subseteq M$ containing $p$
- an open subset $\U' \subseteq\R^n$
- a homeomorphism $\varphi: U'\to\U'$
</details>
</MathBox>

An $n$-dimensional topological manifold is a Hausdorff topological space $(M, \mathcal{T})$ with a second-countable basis for the topology which is locally homeomorphic to $\R^n$ (Euclidean space).

## Coordinate charts

<MathBox title='Coordinate chart' boxType='definition'>
A (coordinate) chart on a topological $n$-manifold $M$ is a pair $(U, \varphi)$ where $U$ is an open subset of $M$, called a coordinate domain/neighbourhood, and $\varphi:U\to \tilde{U}$, called a (local) coordinate map, is a homemorphism to an open subset $\tilde{U} = \varphi(U)\subseteq\R^n$. The collection of charts $\mathcal{A} := \Set{ \left( U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha \right) }$ covering $M$, i.e. $M = \bigcup_\alpha U_\alpha$, is called an atlas. 
</MathBox>

Given a chart $(U, \varphi)$, the coordinate domain $U$ get some special names depending on the shape of the image $\varphi(U)$:
- if $\varphi(U)$ is an open ball, $U$ is called a *coordinate ball*
- if $\varphi(U)$ is an open cube, $U$ is called a *coordinate cube

Because a topological $n$-manifold $M$ is local homeomorphic to $\R^n$, each point $p \in M$ is contained in the domain of some chart $(U,\varphi)$.

## Submanifolds

If $M$ is an $n$-manifold, then $M_0 \subseteq M$ is called a $k$-dimensional submanifold of $M$ if for all $\mathbf{p}\in M_0$ there is a chart $(U, h)$ of $M$ with

$$
  h\left[M_0 \cap U \right] = \left(\R^k \times \mathbf{0}_{n-k} \right) \cup U'
$$

where $(U, h)$ is called a submanifold chart for $M_0$.

## $n$-sphere

For $n\in\N_+$, a unit $n$-sphere is defined as (in terms of the Euclidean norm) the set

$$
  S^n := \Set{\mathbf{x} \in\R^{n+1} | \| \mathbf{x} \| = 1}
$$

An $n$-sphere is a topological subspace of $\R^{n+1}$ and is thus Hausdorff and second-countable. To show that an $n$-sphere is locally homeomorphic to $\R^n$, note that it it can be covered by open sets given by 

$$
  U_i^\pm := \Set{(x^i)_{i=1}^{n+1} \in\R^{n+1} | \pm x^i > 0}
$$

where $U_i^+$ and $U_i^-$ denote the subsets of $\R^{n+1}$ where the $i$th coordinate is positive and negative, respectively. 

Let $f:B^n \to\R$ be the continuous function $f(\mathbf{u}) = \sqrt{1 - \|\mathbf{u}\|^2}$, where $B^n$ is the unit $n$-ball. For each $i=1,\dots,n+1$, it is easily seen that $U_i^+ \cap S^n$ is the grap of the function

$$
  x^i = f(x^1,\dots, x^{i-1},x^{i+1},\dots,x^{n+1})
$$

Similarly, $U_i^- \cap S^n$ is the graph of the function

$$
  x^i = -f(x^1,\dots, x^{i-1},x^{i+1},\dots,x^{n+1})
$$

Thus, each subset $U_i^\pm \cap S^n$ is locally homeomorphic to $\R^n$ and the maps $\varphi_i^\pm (x^1,\dots,x^{n+1}) = (x^1,\dots,x^{i-1},x^{i+1},\dots,x^n)$, removing the $i$th coordinate, are graph coordinates for $S^n$. Since each point of $S^n$ is in the domain of least one of these $2n + 2$ charts, $S^n$ is a topological $n$-manifold.

## Projective space

Recall that the projective space is defined as $P^n (\R) := S^n / \sim$ with the equivalence relation $\mathbf{x}\sim \mathbf{y} :\iff \mathbf{x}=\pm \mathbf{y}$. The canonical projection $\pi: S^n \rightarrow S^n / \sim$ is given by $\mathbf{x} \mapsto [\mathbf{x}]_\sim$. The projective space can be covered by open sets

$$
  V_i := \Set{ [\mathbf{x}]_\sim \in P^n (\R) | x^i \neq 0 }
$$

The pre-image of $V_i$ under $\pi$ is given by 

$$
  \pi^{-1}\left[ V_i \right] = U_i^+ \cup U_i^-
$$

where $U_i^\pm := \Set{\mathbf{x} \in \R^{n+1} | \pm x^i > 0}$ are open hemispheres. 

Define charts $\varphi_i : V_i \rightarrow \tilde{V}_i \subseteq \R^n$ can be formed by taking the slopes with respect to the $i$th component

$$
  \varphi_i\left( [\mathbf{x}]_\sim \right) = \left( \frac{x^1}{x^i}, \dots, \frac{x_{i-1}}{x^i},\frac{x^{i+1}}{x^i},\dots,\frac{x^{n+1}}{x^i} \right)
$$

This map is well-defined because its value is unchanged by multiplying $x$ by a nonzero constant. Because $\varphi_i \circ \pi$ is continuous, $\varphi_i$ is continuous by the characteristic property of quotient maps. It is in fact a hemomorphism with a continuous inverse

$$
  \varphi^{-1}\left(\tilde{x}^i \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\tilde{x}^i \right)^2}}\left( \tilde{x}^1,\dots, \tilde{x}^{i-1}, 1, \tilde{x}^{i+1}, \dots, \tilde{x}^{n} \right)
$$

## Topological properties of manifolds

<MathBox title='' boxType='lemma'>
Every topological manifold has a countable basis of precompact coordinate balls.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $M$ be a topological $n$-manifold. First, we consider the special case in which $M$ can be covered by a single chart. Support $\varphi: M\to \tilde{U} \subseteq\R^n$ is a global coordinate map, and let $\mathcal{B}$ be the collection of all open balls $B_r (\mathbf{x})\subseteq\R^n$ such that $r$ is rational, $x$ has rational coordinates, and $B_{r'}(\mathbf{x}) \subseteq \tilde{U}$ for some $r' > r$. Each such ball is precompact in $\tilde{U}$, and it is easy to check that $\mathcal{B}$ is a countable basis for the topology of $\tilde{U}$. Because $\varphi$ is homeomorphism, it follows that the collection of sets of the form $\varphi^{-1}(B)$ for $B\in\mathcal{B}$ is a countable basis for the topology of $M$, consisting of precompact balls, with the restrictions of $\varphi$ as coordinate maps.

Next, let $M$ be an arbitrary $n$-manifold. By definition, each point $M$ is in the domain of a chart. Because every open cover of a second-countable space has a countable subcover, $M$ is covered by countably many charts $\Set{(U_i, \varphi_i)}_{i\in I \subseteq\N}$. By the preceding argument, each coordinate domain $U_i$ has a countable basis of coordinate balls that are precompact in $U_i$, and the union of all these countable basis is a countable basis for the topology of $M$. If $V\subseteq U_i$ is one of these balls, then the closure of $V$ in $U_i$ is compact, and because $M$ is Hausdorff, it is closed in $M$. It follows that the closure of $V$ in $M$ is the same as its closure in $U_i$, so $V$ is precompact in $M$ as well.

<MathBox title='Connectivity properties of manifolds' boxType='proposition'>
If $M$ is a topological manifold, then
1. $M$ is locally path-connected
2. $M$ is connected if and only if it is path-connected
3. the components of $M$ are the same as its path components
4. $M$ has countably many components, each of which is an open subset of $M$ and a connected topological manifold

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Since each coordinate ball is path-connected, **(1)** follows from the fact that $M$ has a basis of coordinate balls. Parts **(2)** and **(3)** follow directly from **(1)**. To prove **(4)**, note the each component is open in $M$ by proposition *X*, so the collection of components is an open cover of $M$. Because $M$ is second-countable, this cover must have a countable subcover. Since the components are all disjoint, the cover must have been countable to begin with, which is to say that $M$ has only countably many components. Because the components are open, they are connected topological manifolds in the subspace topology.

<MathBox title='Paracompactness' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a topological space. A collection $\mathcal{X}$ of subsets of $M$ is *locally finite* if each point of $M$ has a neighbourhood that intersects at most finitely many of the sets in $\mathcal{X}$. Given a cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $M$, another cover $\mathcal{V}$ is a called a refinement of $U$ if for each $V\in\mathcal{V}$ there exists some $U\in\mathcal{U}$ such that $V\subseteq U$. We say that $M$ is paracompact if every open cover of $M$ admits an open, locally finite refinement.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Manifolds are paracompact' boxType='theorem'>
Every topological manifold is paracompact. In fact, given a topological manifold $M$, an open cover $\mathcal{X}$ of $M$, and any basis $\mathcal{B}$ for the topology of $M$, there exists a countable, locally finite open refinement of $\mathcal{X}$, consisting of elements of $\mathcal{B}$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $(K_j)_{j=1}^\infty$ be an exhaustion of $M$ by compact sets. For each $j$, let $V_j = K_{j+1}/\mathrm{int}(K_j)$ and $W_j = \mathrm{int}(K_{j+1})/K_{j-1}$, where $K_j = \emptyset$ for $j < 1$. Then $V_j$ is a compact set contained in the open subset $W_j$. For each $x\in V_j$ there is some $X_x \in \mathcal{X}$ containing $x$, and because $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis, there exists $B_x \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B_x \subseteq X_x \cap W_j$. The collection of all such sets $B_x$ as $x$ ranges over $V_j$ is an open cover of $V_j$, and thus has a finite subcover. The union of all such finite subcovers as $j$ ranges over the positive integers is a countable open cover of $M$ that refines $\mathcal{X}$. Because the finite subcover of $V_j$ consists of sets contained in $W_j$, and $W_j \cap W_{j'} = \emptyset$ except when $j-2 \leq j' \leq j+2$, the resulting cover is locally finite.

## Manifolds with boundary

<MathBox title='Upper half space' boxType='definition'>
The upper half space $H^n \subseteq\R^n$ is defined as

$$
  H^n := \Set{(x^i)_{i=1}^n \in\R^n | x^n \geq 0}
$$

with interior $\mathrm{int}(H^n)$ and boundary $\partial H^n$ given by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{int}(H^n) =& \Set{(x^i)_{i=1}^n \in\R^n | x^n > 0} \\
  \partial H^n =& \Set{(x^i)_{i=1}^n \in\R^n | x^n = 0}
\end{align*}
$$

If $n=0$, then $H^0 = \R^0 = \Set{0}$ with $\mathrm{int}(H^n) = \R^0$ and $\partial H^0 = \emptyset$.
</MathBox>

A topological $n$-manifold with boundary is a second-countable Hausdorff space $M$ in which every point has a neighbourhood homoemorphic either to an open subset of $\R^n$ or to a (relatively) open subset of $H^n$.

An open subset $U\subseteq M$ together with a map $\varphi: U\to\R^n$ that is homeomorphic with an open subset of $\R^n$ or $H^n$ is called a chart for $M$. If $\varphi(U)$ is a open subset of $\R^n$, including an open subset of $H^n$ that does not intersect $\partial H^n$, then $(U,\varphi)$ is an interior chart. If $\varphi(U)$ is an open subset of $H^n$ such that $\varphi(U)\cap\partial H^n \neq\emptyset$, then $(U,\varphi)$ is called a *boundary chart*. A boundary chart whose image is a set of the form $B_r(\mathbf{x}) \cap H^n$ for some $\mathbf{x}\in\partial H^n$ and $r > 0$ is called a *coordinate half-ball*.

A point $p\in M$ is called an *interior point* of $M$, i.e. $p\in\mathrm{int}(M)$ if it is in the domain of some interior chart. It is a *boundary point* of $M$, i.e. $p\in\partial M$, if it is in the domain of a boundary chart that sends $p$ to $\partial H^n$.

<MathBox title='Topological invariance of the boundary' boxType='theorem'>
If $M$ is a topological manifold with boundary, then each point of $M$ is either a boundary point or an interior point, but not both. Thus, $\partial M$ and $\mathrm{int}(M)$ are disjoint sets whose union is $M$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a topological $n$-manifold with boundary.
1. $\mathrm{int}(M)$ is an open subset of $M$ and a topological $n$-manifold without boundary
2. $\partial M$ is a closed subset of $M$ and a topological $(n-1)$-manifold without boundary
3. $M$ is a topological manifold if and only if $\partial M = \emptyset$
4. if $n=0$, then $\partial M = \emptyset$ and $M$ is a $0$-manifold

# Smooth manifolds

## Smooth structure

<MathBox title='Diffeomorphism' boxType='theorem'>
Let $U \subseteq \R^n$ and $U \subseteq \R^m$ be open subsets of Euclidean space. A function $f: U \rightarrow V$ is $k$-times continuously differentiable, i.e. $f \in C^k$, if all partial derivatives of $f$ up to the $k$-th order exist and are continuous. For $k=\infty$, $f\in C^\infty$ is called *smooth* or *infinitely differentiable*. If $f$ is bijective with a differentiable inverse map, it is called a *diffeomorphism*, which by definition is a homeomorphism.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Smooth manifold' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a topological $n$-manifold. If $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ are two charts such that $U\cap V \neq \emptyset$, the composite chart $\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}: \varphi(U\cap V) \to\psi(U\cap V=$ is called the *transition map* from $\varphi$ to $\psi$. It is a composition of homeomorphisms, and is thus itself a homeomorphism. Two charts $(U,\varphi)$ and $\psi(U\cap V)$ are *smoothly compatible* if either $U\cap V = \emptyset$ or the transition map $\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is a diffeomorphism. 

An atlas $\mathcal{A}$ on $M$ is called a *smooth atlas* if any two charts in $\mathcal{A}$ are smoothly compatible with each other. A smooth atlas $\mathcal{A}$ is *maximal* (complete) if it is not properly contained in any larger smooth atlas. 

A *smooth structure* on $M$ is a maximal smooth atlas. A smooth (differentiable) manifold $(M, \mathcal{A})$ is a topological manifold $M$ equipped with a maximal smooth atlas $\mathcal{A}$, called a smooth structure. 
</MathBox>

The notion of smooth structure can be specified in different ways by changing the compatibility requirements for charts:
- A $C^k$ structure requires each transition map to be $C^k$ diffeomorphic. A manifold endowed with such a structure is called a $C^k$ manifold.
- A *real-analytic structure* requires that each transition map is expressible as a convergent power series in a neighbourhood of each point. A manifold endowed with such a structure is called a *real-analytic manifold*.
- If $M$ has even dimension $n = 2m$, we can identify $\R^{2m}$ with $\mathrm{C}^m$ and require that the transition maps be complex-analytic, yielding a *complex-analytic manifold*.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a topological $n$-manifold.
1. Every smooth atlas $\mathcal{A}$ for $M$ is contained in a unique maximal smooth atlas, called the smooth structure determined by $\mathcal{A}$.
2. Two smooth atlases for $M$ determine the same smooth structure if and only if their union is a smooth atlas.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a smooth atlas for $M$ and let $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ denote the set of all charts that are smoothly compatible with every chart in $\mathcal{A}$. To show that $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ is a smooth atlas, we need to show that any two charts of $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ are smoothly compatible with each other, that is for ny $(U,\varphi), (V,\psi)\in\overline{\mathcal{A}}$, the transition map $\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}: \varphi(U\cap V)\to \psi(U\cap V)$ is smooth.

Let $\mathbf{x} = \varphi(p) \in \varphi(U \cap V)$ be arbitrary. Because that domains of the charts in $\mathcal{A}$ cover $M$, there is some chart $(W,\theta)\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $p\in W$. Since every chart in $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ is smoothly compatible with $(W,\theta)$, both of the maps $\theta\circ\varphi^{-1}$ and $\psi\circ\theta^{-1}$ are smooth where they are defined. Since $p\in U\cap V\cap W$, it follows that $\psi\circ\varphi^{-1} = (\psi\circ\theta^{-1})\circ(\theta\circ\varphi^{-1})$ is smooth on a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{x}$. Thus, $\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is smooth in a neighbourhood of each point in $\varphi(U\cap V)$. Therefore, $\mathcal{A}$ is a smooth atlas. To that it is maximal, note that any chart that is smoothly compatible with every chart in $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ must in particular be smoothly compatible with every chart in $\mathcal{A}$, so it is already on $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$. This proves the existence of a maximal smooth atlas containing $\mathcal{A}$. If $\mathcal{B}$ is any other maximal smooth atals containin $\mathcal{A}$, each of its charts is smoothly compatible with each chart in $\mathcal{A}$, so $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\overline{\mathcal{A}}$. By maximality of $\mathcal{B}$, it follows that $\mathcal{B} = \overline{\mathcal{A}}$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Regular coordinate ball' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ is a smooth manifold, any set $B\subseteq M$ is a *regular coordinate ball* if there is a smooth coordinate ball $B' \supseteq \overline{B}$ and a smooth coordinate map $\varphi: B' \to\R^n$ such that for some positive real numbers $r < r'$

$$
\begin{align*}
  \varphi(B) =& B_r (0) \\
  \varphi(\overline{B}) =& \overline{B}_r (0) \\
  \varphi(B') = B_{r'}(0)
\end{align*}
$$

Because $\overline{B}$ is homeomorphic to $\overline{B}_r (0)$ it is compact, and thus every regular coordinate ball is precompact in $M$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='lemma'>
Every smooth manifold has a countable basis of regular coordinate balls.

## Smooth structures on manifolds with boundary

Recall that a map from an arbitrary subset $A\subseteq\R^n \to\R^n$ is smooth if, in a neighbourhood of each point of $A$, it admits an extension to a smooth map defined on an open subset of $\R^n$. Thus, if $U$ is an open subset of $H^n$, a map $F:U\to\R^n$ is smooth if for each $\mathbf{x}\in U$, there exists an open substeq $\tilde{U}\subseteq\R^n$ containing $\mathbf{x}$ and a smooth map $\tilde{F}:\tilde{U}\to\R^k$ that agrees with $F$ on $\tilde{U}\cap H^n$.

If $F$ is such a map, the restriction of $F$ to $U\cap\mathrm{int}(H^n)$ is smooth in the usual sense. By continuity, all partial derivatives of $F$ at points of $U\cap\partial H^n$ are determined by their values in $\mathrm{int}(H^n)$, and there in particular are independent of the choice of extension. It is a fact that $F:U\to\R^k$ is smooth in this sense if and only if $F$ is continuous, $F|_{U\cap\mathrm{int}(H^n)}$ is smooth, and the partial derivatives of $F|_{U\cap\mathrm{int}(H^n)}$ of all orders have continuous extensions to all of $U$.

Let $M$ be a topological manifold with boundary. A smooth structure for $M$ is defined to be a maximal smooth atlas, a collection of charts whose domains cover $M$ and whose transition maps (and their inverses) are smooth in the sense just described. With such a structure, $M$ is called a smooth manifold with boundary.

A subset $B\subseteq M$ is a *regular coordinate half-ball* if there is a smooth coordinate half-ball $B' \supseteq \overline{B}$ and a smooth coordinate map $\varphi: B'\to H^n$ such that for some $r' > r > 0$ we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \varphi(B) =& B_r (\mathbf{0}) \cap H^n \\
  \varphi(\overline{B}) =& \overline{B}_r(\mathbf{0}) \cap H^n \\
  \varphi(B') = B_{r'} =& B_{r'} (\mathbf{0}) \cap H^n
\end{align*}
$$

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M_1,\dots,M_k$ are smooth manifolds and $N$ is a smooth manifold with boundary. Then $M_1 \times\cdots\times M_k \times N$ is a smooth manifold with boundary, and $\partial(M_1 \times\cdots\times M_k \times N) = M_1 \times\cdots\times M_k \times \partial N$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Smooth invariance of the boundary' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with boundary and $p\in M$. If there is some smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ such that $\varphi(U)\subseteq H^n$ and $\varphi(p)\in \partial H^n$, then same is true for every smooth chart whose domain contains $p$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose on the contrary that $p$ is in the domain of a smooth interior chart $(U,\psi)$ and also in the domain of a smooth boundary chart $(V,\varphi)$ such that $\varphi(p)\in\partial H^n$. Let $\tau = \varphi\circ\psi^{-1}$ denote the transition map, which is a homeomorphism from $\psi(U\cap V)$ to $\varphi(U \cap V)$. The smooth compatibility of the charts ensures that both $\tau$ and $\tau^{-1}$ are smooth, in the sense that locally they can be extended, if necessary, to smooth maps defined on open subsets of $\R^n$.

Write $\mathbf{x}_0 = \psi(p)$ and $\mathbf{y}_0 = \varphi(p) = \tau(\mathbf{x}_0)$. There is some neighbourhood $W$ of $\mathbf{y}_0$ in $\R^n$ and a smooth function $\eta: W\to\R^n$ that agrees with $\tau^{-1}$ on $W\cap\varphi(U\cap V)$. On the other hand, because we are assuming that $\psi$ is an interior chart, there is an open Euclidean ball $B$ that is centered at $x_0$ and contained in $\varphi(U\cap V)$, so $\tau$ itself is smooth on $B$ in the ordinary sense. After shrinking $B$ if necessary, we may assume that $B\subseteq \tau^{-1}(W)$. Then $\eta\circ\tau|_B = \tau^{-1} \circ\tau|_B = \mathrm{id}_B$, so it follows from the chain rule that $\mathrm{D}\eta(\tau(\mathbf{x}))\circ\mathrm{D}\tau(\mathbf{x})$ is the identity map for each $x\in B$. Since $\mathrm{D}\tau(\mathbf{x})$ is a square matrix, this implies that it is non-singular. It follows that $\tau$ as a map from $B\to\R^n$ is an open map, so $\tau(B)$ is an open subset of $\R^n$ that contains $\mathbf{y}_0 = \varphi(p)$ and is contained in $\varphi(V)$. This contradicts the assumption that $\varphi(V)\subseteq H^n$ and $\varphi(p)\in\partial H^n$.

</MathBox>

## Open submanifolds

Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional manifold, and let $S\subseteq M$ be any open subset. Define an atlas on $S$ as a collection $\mathcal{A}_S$ of smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ such that $U\subseteq S$. Every point $\mathbf{p}\in S$ is contained in the domain of some chart $(V,\varphi)$ for $M$. Setting $W = V\cap U$, then $(W, \varphi|_W)$ is a chart in $\mathcal{A}_S$ whose domain contains $\mathbf{p}$. Thus, $S$ is covered by the domains of charts in $\mathcal{A}_S$, and it is easy to verify that this is a smooth atlas for $S$. Hence, any open subset of $M$ is itself a smooth $n$-manifold in a natural way. Endowed with this smooth structure, any open subset is an *open submanifold* of $M$.

## Smooth maps

Generally, the terms *function* and *map* are synonymous. However, it is convenient to make a distinction between them in studying smooth manifolds. In the following discussion the term *function* is reserved for a map whose codomain is a vector space of fields, usually $\R^n$ and $\mathbb{C}^n$ for $n\in\N_+$. Either of the words *map* or *mapping* can mean any type of relation, such as a map between arbitrary manifolds.

### Smooth functions on manifolds

Suppose that $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold. A function $f:M\to\R^k$ for $k\in\N_+$ is smooth if for every $p\in M$ there exists a smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ whose domain contains $p$ and such that the composite function $f\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is smooth on the subset $\tilde{U} = \varphi(U)\subseteq\R^n$. 

If $M$ is a smooth manifold with boundary, $\varphi(U)$ is an open subset of either $\R^n$ or $H^n$, and in the latter case we interpret smoothness of $f\circ\varphi^{-1}$ to mean that each point of $\varphi(U)$ has a neighbourhood on which $f\circ\varphi^{-1}$ extends to a smooth function in the ordinary sense.

Given a function $f:M\to\R^k$ and a chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$, the function $\tilde{f}:\varphi(U)\to\R^k$ defined by $\tilde{f}(\mathbf{x}) = f\circ\varphi^{-1}(\mathbf{x})$ is called the coordinate representation of $f$. By definition, $f$ is smooth if and only if its coordinate representation is smooth in some smooth chart around each point. Smooth functions have smooth coordinate representations in every smooth chart.

### Smooth maps between manifolds

Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds. A map $F:M\to N$ is smooth if for every $p\in M$, there exists smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ containing $p$ and $(V,\psi)$ containing $F(p)$ such that $F(U) \subseteq V$ and the composite map $\psi\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is smooth from $\varphi(U)$ to $\psi(V)$. If $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with boundary, smoothness of $F$ is defined in exactly the same way.

$$
\begin{CD}
  U\subseteq M @>F>> F(U)\subseteq V\subseteq N \\
  @V{\varphi}VV @VV{\psi}V \\
  \varphi(U)\subseteq\R^m @>>\psi\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1}> \psi(V)\subseteq\R^n
\end{CD}
$$

If $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map, and $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ are any smooth charts for $M$ and $N$, respectively, we call $\tilde{F} = \psi\circ F \circ\varphi^{-1}$ the coordinate representation of $F$ with respect to the given coordinates. It maps the set $\varphi(U\cap F^{-1} (V))$ to $\psi(V)$

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Every smooth map is continuous.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and that $F:M\to N$ is smooth. Given $p\in M$, smoothness of $F$ means that there are smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ containing $p$, and $(V,\psi)$ containing $F(p)$, such that $F(U) \subseteq V$ and $\psi\circ F\circ \varphi^{-1}: \varphi(U)\to\psi(V)$ is smooth, hence continuous. Since $\varphi: U\to\varphi(U)$ and $\psi:V\to\psi(V)$ are homemorphisms, it follows that

$$
  F|_U = \psi^{-1}\circ (\psi\circ F\circ \varphi^{-1})\circ\varphi: U\to V
$$

which is a composition of continuous maps. Since $F$ is continuous in a neighbourhood of each point, it is continuous on $M$.

**(4):** Let $p\in M$. By definition of smoothness of $G$, there exists smooth charts $(V,\theta)$ containing $F(p)$ and $(W,\psi)$ contining $G(F(p))$ such that $G(V)\subseteq W$ and $\psi\circ G\circ\theta^{-1}: \theta(V) \to \psi(W)$ is smooth. Since $F$ is continuous, $F^{-1}(V)$ is a neighbourhood of $p\in M$, so there is a smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ such that $p\in U\subseteq F^{-1}(V)$. The coordinate representation $\theta\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is smooth from $\varphi(U)$ to $\theta(V)$. It follows that $G\circ F(U)\subseteq G(V)\subseteq W$ is smooth because it is a composition of smooth maps between subsets of Euclidean spaces.

Suppose that $M$ is a nonempty smooth $m$-manifold, $N$ is a nonempty smooth $n$-manifold, and $F:M\to N$ is a diffeomorphism. Choose any point $p\in M$, and let $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ be smooth coordinate charts containing $p$ and $F(p)$ respectively. Then the restriction of $\tilde{F} = \psi\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1}:\varphi(U)\to\psi(V)$ is a diffeomorphism from an open subset of $\R^m$ to an open subset of $\R^n$. 

Because $\tilde{F}^{-1} \circ\tilde{F} = \mathrm{id}_{\varphi(U)}$, the chain rule implies that for each $\mathbf{x}\in \varphi(U)$

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{id}_{\R^n} =& \mathrm{D}(\mathrm{id}_{\varphi(U)})(\mathbf{x}) = \mathrm{D}(\tilde{F}^{-1}\circ\tilde{F})(\mathbf{x}) \\
  =& \mathrm{D}(\tilde{F}^{-1})(\tilde{F}(\mathbf{x}))\circ\mathrm{D}\tilde{F}(\mathbf{x})
\end{align*}
$$

Similarly, $\tilde{F}\circ\tilde{F}^{-1} = \mathrm{id}_{\psi(V)}$ implies that $\mathrm{id}_{\R^m} = \mathrm{D}F(\mathbf{x})\circ\mathrm{D}(\tilde{F}^{-1})(\tilde{F}(\mathbf{x}))$. This implies that $\mathrm{D}(\tilde{F}(\mathbf{x}))$ is invertible with inverse $\mathrm{D}(\tilde{F}^{-1})(\tilde{F}(\mathbf{x}))$, and hence $m = n$.

1. $0\leq\psi_\alpha(x)\leq 1$ for all $\alpha\in A$ and all $x\in M$

4. $\sum_{\alpha\in A} \psi_\alpha (x) = 1$ for all $x\in M$

If $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, a *smooth parition of unity* is one for which each of the functions $\psi_\alpha$ is smooth.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Existence of partitions of unity' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and $\mathcal{X} = (X_\alpha)_{\alpha\in A}$ is any indexed open cover of $M$. Then there exists a smooth partition of unity subordinate to $\mathcal{X}$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

For simplicity, suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold without boundary. Each set $X_\alpha$ is a smooth manifold in its own right, and thus has a basis $\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ of regular coordinate balls and it is easy to check that $\mathcal{B} = \bigcup_\alpha \mathcal{B}_\alpha$ is a basis for the topology of $M$. It follows that $\mathcal{X}$ has a countable, locally finite refinement $\Set{B_i}$ consisting of elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The cover $\Set{\overline{B}_i}$ is also locally finite.

For each $i$, the fact that $B_i$ is a regular coordinate ball in some $X_\alpha$ guarantees that there is a coordinate ball $B'_i \subseteq X_\alpha$ such that $B'_i \supseteq \overline{B}_i$, and a smooth coordinate map $\varphi_i: B'_i \to\R^n$ such that $\varphi_i(\overline{B}_i) = \overline{B}_{r_i}(\mathbf{0})$ and $\varphi_i(B'_i) = B_{r'_i}(\mathbf{0})$ for some $r_i < r'_i$. For each $i$, defined a function $f_i:M\to\R$ by

$$
  f_i = \begin{cases}
    H_i \circ\varphi_i \quad& \text{on } B'_i \\
    0 \quad& \text{on } M\setminus\overline{B}_i
  \end{cases}
$$

where $H_i:\R^n \to\R$ is a smooth function that is positive in $B_{r_i}(\mathbf{0})$ and zero elsewhere. On the set $B'_i\setminus\overline{B}_i$ where the two definitions overlap, both definitions yield the zero function, $f_i$ is well-defined and smooth with $\mathrm{supp}(f_i) = \overline{B}_i$.

Define $f:M\to\R$ by $f(x) = \sum_i f_i(x)$. Because of the local finiteness of the cover $\Set{\overline{B}_i}$, this sum has only finitely many nonzero terms in a neighbourhood of each point and thus defines a smooth function. Because each $f_i$ is nonnegative everywhere and positive on $B_i$, and every point of $M$ is in some $B_i$, it follows that $f(x) > 0$ everywhere on $M$. Thus, the functions $g_i:M\to\R$ defined by $g_i (x) \frac{f_i (x)}{f(x)}$ are also smooth. It is immediate from the definition that $0\leq g_i \leq 1$ and $\sum_i g_i \equiv 1$.

Finally, we need to reindex our functions so that they are indexed by the same set $A$ as our open cover. Because the cover $\Set{B'_i}$ is a refinement of $\mathcal{X}$, for each $i$ we can choose some index $a(i)\in A$ such taht $B'_i \subseteq X_{a(i)}$. For each $\alpha\in A$, define $\psi_\alpha: M\to\R$ by

$$
  \psi_\alpha = \sum_{i:a(i) = \alpha} g_i
$$

If there are no indices $i$ for which $a(i) = \alpha$, then this sum should be interpreted as the zero function. It follos that

$$
  \mathrm{supp}(\psi_\alpha) = \overline_{\bigcup_{i:a(i) = \alpha} B_i} = \bigcup_{i:a(i) = \alpha} \overline{B}_i \subseteq X_\alpha
$$

Each $\psi_\alpha$ is a smooth function that satisfies $0\leq\psi_\alpha \leq 1$. Moreover, the collection of supports $\Set{\mathrm{supp}(\psi_\alpha)}_{\alpha\in A}$ is still locally finite, and $\sum_\alpha \psi_\alpha \equiv \sum_i g_i \equiv 1$, which is the desired partition of unity.

#### Applications of partitions of unity

<MathBox title='Bump function' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ is a topological space, $A\subseteq M$ is a closed subset, and $U\subseteq M$ is an open subset containing $A$, a continuous function $\psi:M\to\R$ is called a *bump function* for $A$ supported in $U$ if $0\leq\psi\leq 1$ on $M$ and $\psi\equiv 1$ on $A$ and $\mathrm{supp}(\psi) \subseteq U$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Existence of smooth bump functions' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. For any closed subset $A\subseteq M$ and any open subset $U$ containing $A$, there exists a smooth bump function for $A$ supported in $U$.

<details>

Let $U_0 = U$ an $U_1 = M\setminus A$ and let $\Set{\psi_0, \psi_1}$ be a smooth partition of unity subordinate to the open cover $\Set{U_0, U_1}$. Because $\psi_1 \equiv 0$ on $A$ with $\psi_0 = \sum_i \psi_i = 0$, the functino $\psi_0$ has the required properties.

<MathBox title='Extension lemma for smooth function' boxType='lemma'>
Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, $A\subseteq M$ is a closed subset, and $f:A\to\R^k$ is a smooth function. For any open subset $U$ containing $A$, there exists a smooth function $\tilde{f}:M\to\R^k$ such that $\tilde{f}|_A = f$ and $\mathrm{supp}(\tilde{f})\subseteq U$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

For each $p\in A$, choose a neighbourhood $W_p$ of $p$ and a smooth function $\tilde{f}_p :W_p \to R^k$ that agrees with $f$ on $W_p \cap A$. Replacing $W_p$ by $W_p \cap U$, we may assume $W_p \subseteq U$. The collection of sets $\Set{W_p | p\in A}\cup M\setminus A$ is an open cover of $M$. Let $\Set{\psi_p | p\in A} \cup \Set{\psi_0}$ be a smooth partition of unity subordinate to this cover, with $\mathrm{supp}(\psi_p)\subseteq W_p$ and $\mathrm{supp}(\psi_0) \subseteq M\setminus A$.

For each $p\in A$, the product $\psi_p \tilde{f}_p$ is smooth on $W_p$, and has a smooth extension to all of $M$ if we interpret it to be zero on $M\setminus\mathrm{supp}(\psi_p)$. Thus, we can defined $\tilde{f}: M\to\R^k$ by

$$
  \tilde{f}(x) = \sum_{p\in A} \psi_p (x)\tilde{f}_p (x)
$$

Because the collection of supports $\Set{\psi_p}$ is locally finite, this sum has only a finite number of nonzero terms in a neighbourhood of any point of $M$, and therefore defines a smooth function. If $x\in A$, then $\psi_0 (x) = 0$ and $\tilde{f}_p (x) = f(x)$ for each $p$ such that $\psi_p (x) \neq 0$, so

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{f}(x) =& \sum_{p\in A} \psi_p(x)f(x) \\
  =& \left( \psi_0(x) + \sum_{p\in A} \psi_p (x) \right)f(x) \\
  =& f(x)
\end{align*}
$$

so $\tilde{f}$ is indeed an extension of $f$. It follows that 

$$
  \mathrm{supp}(\tilde{f}) = \overline{\bigcup_{p\in A}\mathrm{supp}(\psi_p)} = \bigcup_{p\in A} \mathrm{supp}(\psi_p) \subseteq U
$$

<MathBox title='Exhaustion function' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ is a topological space, and *exhaustion function* for $M$ is a continuous function $f:M\to\R$ with the property that the set $f^{-1}((-\infty,c])$, called the sublevel set of $f$, is compact for each $c\in\R$. As $n$ ranges over the positive integers, the sublevel sets $f^{-1}((-\infty, n])$ form an exhaustion of $M$ by compact sets.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Existence of smooth exhaustion functions' boxType='proposition'>
Every smooth manifold with or without boundary admits a smooth positive exhaustion function.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\Set{V_j}_{j=1}^\infty$ be any countable open cover of $M$ by precompact open subsets, and let $\Set{\psi_j}$ be a smooth partition of unity subordinate to this cover. Define $f\in C^\infty (M)$ by

$$
  f(p) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty j\psi_j(p)
$$

Then $f$ is smooth because only finitely many terms are nonzero in a neighbourhood of any point, and positive because $f(p) \geq\sum_j \psi_j (p) = 1$.

To see that $f$ is an exhaustion function, let $c\in\R$ be arbitrary, and choose a positive integer $N > c$. If $p\notin \bigcup_{j=1}^N \overline{V}_j$, then $\psi_j(p) = 0$ for $1\leq j\leq N$, so

$$
\begin{align*}
  f(p) =& \sum_{j=N+1}^\infty j\psi_j (p) \\
  \geq& \sum_{j=N+1}^\infty N\psi_j (p) \\
  =& N\sum_{j=1}^\infty \psi_j (p) = N > c
\end{align*}
$$

Equivalently, if $f(p) \leq c$, then $p\in \bigcup_{j=1}^N \overline{V}_j$. Thus $f^{-1}((-\infty, c])$ is a closed subset of the compact set $\bigcup_{j=1}^N \overline{V}_j$ and is therefore compact.

<MathBox title='Level sets of smooth functions' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. If $K$ is any closed subset of $M$, there is a smooth nonnegative function $f:M\to\R$ such that $f^{-1}(0) = K$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**$M = \R^n$**<br/>
First, consider the special case in which $M = \R^n$ and $K\subseteq\R^n$ is a closed subset. For each $x \in M\setminus K$, there is a positive number $r \leq 1$ such that $B_r (x) \subseteq M\setminus K$. By second-countability, $M\subseteq K$ is the union of countably many such balls $\Set{B_{r_i}(x_i)}_{i=1}^\infty$.

Let $h:\R^n \to\R$ be a smooth bump function that is equal to $1$ on $\overline{B}_{1/2} (0)$ and supported in $B_1 (0)$. For each positive integer $i$, let $C_i \geq 1$ be a constant that bounds the absolute values of $h$ and all of its partial derivatives up through order $i$. Define $f:\R^n \to\R$ by

$$
  f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{(r_i)^i}{2^i C_i} h\left( \frac{x-x_i}{r_i} \right)
$$

The terms of the series are bounded in absolute value by those of the convergent series $\sum_i \frac{1}{2^i}$, so the entire series converges uniformly to a continuous function by the Weierstrass $M$-test. Because the $i$th term is positive extactly when $x\in B_{r_i}(x_i)$, it follows that $f$ is zero in $K$ and positive elsewhere.

It remains to show that $f$ is smooth. Suppose that $k\geq 1$ and assume by induction that all partial derivatives of $f$ of order less than $k$ exist and are continuous. By the chain rule and induction, every $k$th partial derivative of the $i$th term in the series can be written in the form

$$
  \frac{(r_i)^{i-k}}{2^i C_i} \mathrm{D}_k\left[h\left( \frac{x - x_i}{r_i} \right)\right]
$$

where $\mathrm{D}_k (h)$ is some $k$th partial derivative of $h$. By our choices of $r_i$ and $C_i$, as as $i\geq k$, each of these terms is bounded in absolute value by $\frac{1}{2^i}$, so the differentiated series also converges uniformly to a continuous function. It the follows from properties of uniform convergence that the $k$th partial derivatives of $f$ exist and are continuous. This completes the induction, and show that $f$ is smooth.

**$M$ arbitrary smooth manifold**<br/>
Let $M$ be an arbitrary smooth manifold, and $K\subseteq M$ any closed subset. Let $\Set{B_\alpha}$ be an open cover of $M$ by smooth coordinate balls, and let $\Set{\psi_\alpha}$ be a subordinate partition of unity. Since each $B_\alpha$ is diffeomorphic to $\R^n$, the preceeding argument show that for each $\alpha$ there is a smooth nonnegative function $f_\alpha: B_\alpha \to\R$ such that $f_\alpha^{-1}(0) = B_\alpha \cap K$. The functino $f = \sum_\alpha \psi_\alpha f_\alpha$ does the trick.

# Tangent space

## Geometric tangent vectors

<MathBox title='Geometric tangent vector' boxType='definition'>
Given a point $\mathbf{a}\in\R^n$, the *geometric tangent space* to $\R^n$ at $\mathbf{a}$, denoted $\R_\mathbf{a}^n$, is the set 

$$
  \Set{\mathbf{a}} \times \R^n = \Set{(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a} | \mathbf{v}\in \R^n}
$$

A *geometric tangent vector* $\mathbf{v}$ in $\R^n$ is an element of $\R_\mathbf{a}^n$ with initial point at $\mathbf{a}\in\R^n$. The set $\R_\mathbf{a}^n$ is a vector space.
</MathBox>

As a vector space, $\R_\mathbf{a}^n$ is essentially the same as $\R^n$ itself; the only reason for the additional index $\mathbf{a}$ is so that the geometric tangent spaces $\R_\mathbf{a}^n$ and $\R_\mathbf{b}^n$ at distinct points $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}\in \R^n$ will be disjoint sets.

The directional derivate of a geometric tangent vector $\mathbf{v}$ at $\mathbf{a}$ is a map $\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}: C^\infty (\R^n) \to\R$ defined by

$$
  \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(f) = \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v} f(\mathbf{a}) = \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t=0} f(\mathbf{a} + t\mathbf{v})
$$

This operation is linear over $\R$ and satisfies the product rule

$$
  \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a} (fg) = f(\mathbf{a})\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(g) + g(a)\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(f)
$$

If $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a} = v^i \mathbf{e}_i|_\mathbf{a}$ in terms of the standard basis, then by the rule, $\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(f)$ can written as

$$
  \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(f) = v^i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{a})
$$

<MathBox title='Derivation' boxType='definition'>
If $\mathbf{a}$ is a point of $\R^n$, a function $w: C^\infty (\R^n)\to\R$ is called a *derivation* at $\mathbf{a}$ if it is linear over $\R$ and satisfies the following product rule

$$
  w(fg) = f(\mathbf{a})wg + g(\mathbf{a})wf
$$
</MathBox>

Let $T_\mathbf{a}\R^n$ denote the set of all derivations of $C^\infty(\R^n)$ at $\mathbf{a}$. Clearly, $T_\mathbf{a} \R^n$ is a vector space under the operations

$$
\begin{align*}
  (w_1 + w_2)f =& w_1 f + w_2 f \\
  (cw)f =& c(wf)
\end{align*}
$$

<MathBox title='Properties of derivations' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $\mathbf{a}\in\R^n$, $w\in T_\mathbf{a} \R^n$ and $f,g\in C^\infty(\R^n)$.
1. If $f$ is a constant function, then $wf = 0$.
2. If $f(\mathbf{a}) = g(\mathbf{a}) = 0$, then $w(fg) = 0$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** It suffices to consider the constant function $f_1 (\mathbf{x}) \equiv 1$, for then $f(\mathbf{x}) \equiv c$ implies $wf = w(cf_1) = cw f_1 = 0$ by linearity. For $f_1$, the product rule gives

$$
\begin{align*}
  wf_1 =& w(f_1 f_1) \\
  =& f_1 (\mathbf{a})wf_1 + f_1 (\mathbf{a})w f_1 = 2wf_1
\end{align*}
$$

which implies that $wf_1 = 0$.

**(2):** Applyting the product rule gives

$$
  w(fg) = f(\mathbf{a})wg + g(\mathbf{a})wf = 0 + 0 = 0

Let $\mathbf{a}\in\R^n$.
1. For each geometric tangent vector $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a} \in\R_\mathbf{a}^n$, the directional derivative $\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}: C^\infty (\R^n) \to\R$ is a derivation at $\mathbf{a}$.
2. The map $\mathbf{v}_a \mapsto \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}$ is an isomorphism from $\R_\mathbf{a}^n$ onto $T_\mathbf{a}\R^n$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** This follows from the product rule of the directional derivative.

**(2):** It is easily seen that $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a} \mapsto \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}$ is linear. To see that it is injective, suppose that $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a}\in\R_\mathbf{a}^n$ has the property that $\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}$ is the zero derivation. Writing $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a} = v^i \mathbf{e}_i|_\mathbf{a}$ in terms of the standard basis, and taking $f$ to be the $j$th coordinate function $x^j: \R^n\to\R$ thought of as a smooth function on $\R^n$, we obtain

$$
  0 = \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(x^j) = v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}(x^j)\right|_{\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{a}} = v^i \delta_i^j = v^j
$$

Since this is true for each $j$, it follows that $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a}$ is the zero vector.

To prove surjectivity, let $w\in T_\mathbf{a} \R^n$ be arbitrary and define $\mathbf{v} = v^i \mathbf{e}_i$ where $v^i = w(x^i)$. We will show that $w = \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}$. Let $f:\R^n \to\R$ be any smooth function. By Taylor's theorem, we can write

$$
\begin{align*}
  f(\mathbf{x}) =& f(\mathbf{a}) + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf{a})(x^i - a^i) \\
  &+ \sum_{i,j=1}^n (x^i - a^i)(x^j - a^j) \int_0^1 (1-t)\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}(\mathbf{a} + t(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a}))\;\mathrm{d}t
\end{align*}
$$

Note that each term in the last sum above is a product of two smooth functions of $\mathbf{x}$ that vanish at $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{a}$: one is (x^i - a^i), and the other is $(x^j - a^j)$ times the integral. The derivation $w$ annihilates this sum by its properties, giving

$$
\begin{align*}
  wf =& w(f(\mathbf{a})) + \sum_{i=1}^n w\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{a})(x^i - a^i)\right) \\
  =& 0 + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(x)(w(x^i) - w(a^i)) \\
  =& \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} (\mathbf{a})v^i = \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(f)

## Differential of a smooth map

<MathBox title='Differential' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary and $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map, the differential of $F$ at $\mathbf{p}\in M$ is the map

$$
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p} : T_\mathbf{p} M \to T_{F(\mathbf{p})}N
$$

defined as follows. Given $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p} M$, we let $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v})$ be the derivation at $F(\mathbf{p})$ that acts on $f\in C^\infty$ by the rule

$$
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{v}(f\circ F)
$$

Note that if $f\in C^\infty (N)$, then $f\circ F \in C^\infty (M)$, so $\mathbf{v}(f\circ F)$ makes sense. The operator $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v}): C^\infty (N)\to\R$ is linear because $\mathbf{v}$ is, and is a derivation at $F(\mathbf{p})$ because for any $f,g\in C^\infty (N)$ we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v})(fg) =& \mathbf{v}((fg)\circ F) = \mathbf{v}((f\circ F)(g\circ F)) \\
  =& f\circ F(\mathbf{p})\mathbf{v}(g\circ F) + g\circ F(\mathbf{p})\mathbf{v}(f\circ F) \\
  =& f(F(\mathbf{p}))\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v})(g) + g(F(\mathbf{p}))\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v})(f)

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, $\mathbf{p}\in M$ and $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p} M$. If $f,g\in C^\infty(M)$ agree on some neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$, then $\mathbf{v}f = \mathbf{v}g$.

Let $h = f - g$ so that $h$ is a smooth function that vanishes in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$. Let $\psi\in C^\infty (M)$ be a smooth bump function that is identically equal to $1$ on the support of $h$ and is supported in $M\setminus\Set{\mathbf{p}}$. Because $\psi\equiv 1$ where $h$ is nonzero, the product $\psi h$ is identically equal to $h$. Since $h(\mathbf{p}) = \psi(\mathbf{p}) = 0$, it follows that $\mathbf{v}h = \mathbf{v}(\psi h) = 0$. By linearity, this implies $\mathbf{v}f = \mathbf{v}g$.

<MathBox title='The tangent space to an open submanifold' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, $U\subseteq M$ an open subset, and let $\iota: U \hookrightarrow M$ be the inclusion map. For every $\mathbf{p}\in U$, the differential $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p} U \to T_\mathbf{p} M$ is an isomorphism.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

To show injectivity, suppose that $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p} U$ and $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v}) = 0\in T_\mathbf{p} M$. Let $B$ a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ such that $\overline{B} \subseteq U$. If $f\in C^\infty (U)$ is arbitrary, the extension lemma for smooth function guarantees that there exists $\tilde{f}\in C^\infty(M)$ such that $\tilde{f}\equiv f$ on $\overline{B}$. Then since $f$ and $\tilde{f}|_U$ are smooth function on $U$ that agree in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$, it follows from the previous proposition that

$$
  \mathbf{v}f = \mathbf{v}(\tilde{f}|_U) = \mathbf{v}(\tilde{f}\circ\iota) = \mathrm{d}\iota(\mathbf{v})_\mathbf{p} \tilde{f} = 0
$$

Since this holds for every $f\in C^\infty (U)$, it follows that $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$, so $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}$ is injective.

To show surjectivity, suppose that $w\in T_\mathbf{p} M$ is arbitrary. Define an operator $\mathbf{v}: C^\infty(U) \to\R$ by setting $\mathbf{v}f = \mathbf{w}\tilde{f}$, where $\tilde{f}$ is any smooth function on all of $M$ that agrees with $f$ on $\overline{B}$. By the previous proposition, $\mathbf{v}f$ is independent of the choice of $\tilde{f}$, so $\mathbf{v}$ is well-defined, and it is easy to check that it is a derivation of $C^\infty (U)$ at $\mathbf{p}$. For any $g\in C^\infty (M)$

$$
  \mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v})g = \mathbf{v}(g\circ\iota) = \mathbf{w}(\tilde{g\circ\iota}) = \mathbf{w}g
$$

where the last two equalities follow from the fact that $g\circ\iota$, $\tilde{g\circ\iota}$ and $g$ all agree on $B$. Thus, $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}$ is also surjective.

If $M$ is a an $n$-dimensional smooth manifold, then for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the tangent space $T_\mathbf{p} M$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Given $\mathbf{p}\in M$, let $(U,\varphi)$ be a smooth coordinate chart containing $\mathbf{p}$. Because $\varphi$ is a diffeomorphism from $U$ onto an open subset $\tilde{U}\subseteq\R^n$, follows from the properties of differentials that $\mathrm{d}\varphi_p$ is an isomorphism from $T_\mathbf{p} U \to T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\tilde{U}$. Since the previous proposition guarantees that $T_\mathbf{p} M \cong T_\mathbf{p} U$ and $T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\tilde{U} \cong T_{\varphi(p)} \R^n$ it follows that $\dim(T_\mathbf{p} M) = \dim(T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\R^n = n$.

Let $\iota:H^n \to\R^n$ denote the inclusion map. For any $\mathbf{a}\in\partial H^n$, the differential $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{a}: T_\mathbf{a} H^n \to T_\mathbf{a} \R^n$ is an isomorphism.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

To show that $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{a}$ is injective, assume that $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{a} (\mathbf{0}) = 0$. Suppose that $f:H^n \to\R^n$ is smooth, and let $\tilde{f}$ be any extension of $f$ to a smooth function defined on all of $\R^n$. Then $\tilde{f}\circ\iota = f$ and

$$
  \mathbf{v}f = \mathbf{v}(\tilde{f}\circ\iota) = \mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{a} (\mathbf{v})\tilde{f} = 0
$$

which implies that $\mathrm{d}\iota_a$ is injective.

To show surjectivity, let $\mathbf{w}\in T_\mathbf{a} \R^n$ be arbitrary. Define $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{a} H^n$ by $\mathbf{v}f = \mathbf{w}\tilde{f}$, where $\tilde{f}$ is any smooth extension of $f$. Writing $\mathbf{w} = w^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{a}$ in terms of the standard basis for $T_\mathbf{a} \R^n$, means that

$$
  \mathbf{v}f = w^i \frac{\partial\tilde{f}}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{a})
$$

This is independent of the choice of $\tilde{f}$, because by continuity the derivatives of $\tilde{f}$ at $\mathbf{a}$ are determined by those of $f$ in $H^n$. It is easy to check that $\mathbf{v}$ is a derivation at $\mathbf{a}$ and that $\mathbf{w} = \mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{a} (\mathbf{v})$, so $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{a}$ is surjective.

Let $\mathbf{p}\in M$ be arbitrary. If $\mathbf{p}\in\mathrm{int}(M)$ it follows that $T_\mathbf{p}(\mathrm{int}(M)) \cong T_\mathbf{p} M$ because $\mathrm{int}(M)$ is an open submanifold. Since $\mathrm{int}(M)$ is a smooth $n$-manifold without boundary, its tangent spaces all have dimension $n$.

If $\mathbf{p}\in\partial M$, let $(U,\varphi)$ be a smooth boundary chart containing $\mathbf{p}$, and let $\tilde{U} = \varphi(U)\subseteq H^n$. Then we have the isomorphisms

$$
  T_\mathbf{p} M \cong T_\mathbf{p} U \cont T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\tilde{U} \cong T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} H^n \cong T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\R^n

<MathBox title='The tangent space to a vector space' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space with its standard smooth manifold structure. For each point $\mathbf{a}\in V$ and vector $\mathbf{v}\in V$, define the directional derivative $\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}:C^\infty (V) \to\R$ by

$$
  \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a} = \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t=0} f(\mathbf{a} + t\mathbf{v})

The map $v \mapsto \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}$ is a canonical isomorphism from $V$ to $T_a V$ such that for any linear map $L: V\to W$, the following diagram commutes:

Suppose that $L:V\to W$ is a linear map. Because its components with respect to any choices of bases for $V$ and $W$ are linear functions of the coordinates, $L$ is smooth. Unwinding the definitions and using the linearity of $L$, we compute

## Coordinate vectors

Suppose that $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold without boundary, and let $(U,\varphi)$ be a smooth coordinate chart on $M$. Since $\varphi: U\to\tilde{U}\subseteq\R^n$ it follows that $\mathrm{d}\varphi_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p} U \to T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \R^n$ is an isomorphism. Furthermore, since $U$ is an open submanifold it follows that $T_\mathbf{p} U \cong T_\mathbf{p} M$ for every $\mathbf{p}\in M$. This implies that $\mathrm{d}\varphi_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p} M \to T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \R^n$ is an isomorphism.

The partial derivatives $\Set{\boldsymbol{\partial}_i\rvert_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}}_{i=1}^{n}$ forms a basis for $T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\R^n$. Thus, the preimages of these vectors under the isomorphism $\mathrm{d}\varphi_\mathbf{p}$ form a basis for $T_\mathbf{p}M$. These vector are denoted $\boldsymbol{\partial_i}|_\mathbf{p} = \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p}$, characterized by either of the following expressions:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} =& (\mathrm{d}\phi_\mathbf{p})^{-1} \left( \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \right) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(\varphi^{-1})_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \left( \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \right|_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

Unwinding these definitions, we see that $\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p}$ acts on a function $f\in C^\infty (U)$ by

$$
  \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} = \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}(f \circ\varphi^{-1}) = \frac{\partial \tilde{f}}{\partial x^i}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})
$$

where $\tilde{f} = f\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is the coordinate representation of $f$, $\tilde{\mathbf{p}} = (p^i)_{i=1}^n = \varphi(\mathbf{p})$ is the coordinate representation of $\mathbf{p}$. In other vords, $\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p}$ is just the derivation that takes the partial derivative of $f$ at $\mathbf{p}$. The vectors $\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p}$ are called the *coordinate vectors* at $\mathbf{p}$ associated with a given coordinate system. In the special case of standard coordinates on $\R^n$, the vectors $\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p}$ are literally the partial derivative operators.

If $M$ is a smooth manifold with boundary and $\mathbf{p}$ is an interior point, the discussion above applies verbatim. For $\mathbf{p}\in\partial M$, the only change that needs to be made is to substitute $H^n$ for $\R^n$, with the understanding that the notation $\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}$ can be used interchangeably to denote either an element of $T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \R^n$ or an element of $T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} H^n$, where we consider the isomorphism $\mathrm{d}\iota_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}: T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}H^n \to T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\R^n$ as an identification. The $n$th coordinte vector $\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p}$ should be interpreted as a one-sided derivative in this case. 

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary, and let $\mathbf{p}\in M$. Then $T_\mathbf{p}M$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space, and for any smooth chart $(U, (x^i))$ containing $\mathbf{p}$, the cordinate vectors $\Set{\boldsymbol{\partial}_i\rvert_\mathbf{p}}_{i=1}^n$ form a basis for $T_\mathbf{p} M$.
</MathBox>

A tangent vector $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p} M$ can be written uniquely as a linear combination

$$
  \mathbf{v} = v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} = v^i \boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p}
$$

The ordered basis $(\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p})_{i=1}^n$ is a called a *coordinate basis* for $T_\mathbf{p} M$ and the scalars $(v^i)_{i=1}^n$ are called the *components* of $\mathbf{v}$ with respect to the coordinate basis. If $\mathbf{v}$ is known, its components can be easily computed from its action on the coordinate functions. For each $j$, the components of $\mathbf{v}$ are given by $v^j = \mathbf{v}(x^j)$, where $x^j:U\to\R$ is a smooth real-valued function, because

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{v}(x^j) =& \left( v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} \right)(x^j) \\
  =& v^i \frac{\partial x^j}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p}) \\
  =& v^i \delta_i^j = v^j
\end{align*}
$$

### Coordinate representation of differentials

In order to find a coordinate representation of differential, consider first the special case of a smooth map $F:U\to V$, where $U\subseteq\R^n$ and $V\subseteq\R^m$ are open subsets of Euclidean spaces. For any $\mathbf{p}\in U$, we determine the matrix of $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p} \R^n \to T_{F(\mathbf{p})} \R^m$ in terms of the standard coordinate bases. Using $(x^i)_{i=1}^n$ to denote the coordinates in the domain and $(y^j)_{j=1}^m$ to denote those in the codomain, we apply the chain rule to compute the action of $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{d}$ on a typical basis vector:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} \right) f =& \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} (f \circ F) \\
  =& \frac{\partial f}{\partial y^j} (F(\mathbf{p})) \frac{\partial F^j}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p}) \\
  =& \left( \frac{\partial F^j}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p}) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial y^j}\right|_{F(\mathbf{p})} \right)f
\end{align*}
$$

Thus

$$
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} \right) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y^j} (F(\mathbf{p})) \frac{\partial F^j}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p})
$$

In other words, the matrix of $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ in terms of the coordinate basis is

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial F^1}{\partial x^1}(\mathbf{p}) & \cdots & \frac{\partial F^1}{\partial x^n}(\mathbf{p}) \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  \frac{\partial F^m}{\partial x^1}(\mathbf{p}) & \cdots & \frac{\partial F^m}{\partial x^n}(\mathbf{p})
\end{bmatrix}
$$

which is called the *Jacobian (matrix)* of $F$ at $\mathbf{p}$. The Jacobian is the matrix representation of the total derivative $\mathrm{D}F(\mathbf{p}): \R^n \to\R^m$. Thus, in this case, $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p}\R^n \to T_{F(\mathbf{p})} \R^m$ corresponds to the total derivative $\mathrm{D}F(\mathbf{p}):\R^n \to\R^m$, under our usual identification of Euclidean spaces with their tangent spaces. The same calcalulation applies if $U$ is an open subset of $H^n$ and $V$ is an open subset of $H^m$.

Consider the more general case of a smooth map $F:M\to N$ between smooth manifolds with or without boundary. Choosing smooth coordinate charts $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ containing $\mathbf{p}\in M$ and $(V,\psi)$ for $N$ containing $F(\mathbf{p})$, we obtain the coordinate representation $\tilde{F} = \psi\circ F\circ^{-1}: \varphi(U\cap F^{-1}(V)) \to\psi(V)$.

Let $\tilde{\mathbf{p}} = \varphi(\mathbf{p})$ denote the coordinate representation of $\mathbf{p}$. By the computation above, $\mathrm{d}\tilde{F}_{\tilde{\mathbf{p}}}$ is represented with respect to the standard coordinate bases by the Jacobian matrix of $\tilde{F}$ at $\tilde{\mathbf{p}}$. Using the factor that $F\circ\varphi^{-1} = \psi^{-1} \circ\tilde{F}$ we get 

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p}\right) =& \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p} \left(\mathrm{d}(\varphi^{-1})_{\tilde{\mathbf{p}}} \left( \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{\tilde{p}} \right) \right) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(\psi^{-1})_{\tilde{F}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})} \left(\mathrm{d}(\tilde{F})_{\tilde{\mathbf{p}}} \left( \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{\tilde{p}} \right) \right) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(\psi^{-1})_{\tilde{F}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})} \left( \frac{\partial\tilde{F}^j}{\partial x^i}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial y^j}\right|_{\tilde{F}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})} \right) \\
  =& \frac{\partial\tilde{F}^j}{\partial x^j}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial y^j}\right|_{F(\mathbf{p})}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is represented in coordinate bases by the Jacobian matrix of $F$. In the fact, the definition of the differential is formulated to give a coordinate-independent meaning to the Jacobian matrix.

### Change of coordinates

Suppose that $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ are two smooth charts on $M$ and $\mathbf{p}\in U \cap B$. Let us denote the coordinate functions of $\varphi$ by $(x^i)$ and those of $\psi$ by $(\hat{x}^i)$, such that the transition map $\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}: \varphi(U \cap V)\to \psi(U\cap V)$ can be written

$$
  \psi\circ\varphi^{-1} (\mathbf{x}) = \left(\hat{x}^i(\mathbf{x}) \right)_{i=1}^n 
$$

The differential $\mathrm{d}(\psi\circ\phi^{-1})_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}$ can be written

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}(\psi\circ\varphi^{-1})_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|\right) = \frac{\partial\hat{x}^j}{\partial x^i}(\varphi(\mathbf{p})) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial\hat{x}^j}\right|_{\psi(\mathbf{p})}
\end{align*}
$$

Using the definitions of coordinate vectors, we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
  \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} =& \mathrm{d}(\varphi^{-1})_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\right) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(\psi^{-1})_{\psi(\mathbf{p})} \circ \mathrm{d}(\psi\circ\varphi^{-1})_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\right) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(\psi^{-1})_{\psi(\mathbf{p})}\left(\frac{\partial\hat{x}^j}{\partial x^i} (\varphi(\mathbf{p})) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial \hat{x}^j}\right|_{\psi(\mathbf{p})} \right) \\
  =& \frac{\partial\tilde{x}^j}{\partial x^i} (\tilde{\mathbf{p}}) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial\hat{x}^j}\right|
\end{align*}
$$

where $\tilde{\mathbf{p}} = \varphi(\mathbf{p})$. Applying this to the components of a vector $\mathbf{v} = v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} = \hat{v}^j \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial\hat{x}^j}\right|_\mathbf{p}$ we find that the components of $\mathbf{v}$ transform by the rule

$$
  \hat{v}^j = \frac{\partial\hat{x}^j}{\partial x^i}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})v^i
$$

## Tangent bundle

<MathBox title='Tangent bundle' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ is a smooth manifold $M$ with or without boundary, the *tangent bundle* of $M$, denoted $TM$, is the disjoint union of the tangent spaces at all points of $M$:

$$
  TM := \bigsqcup_{\mathbf{p}\in M} T_\mathbf{p} M := \bigcup_{\mathbf{p}\in M} \Set{\mathbf{p}} \times T_\mathbf{p} M
$$

The tangent bundle is equipped with a natural *projection map* $\pi:TM \to M$, sending each vector in $T_\mathbf{p} M$ to the point $\mathbf{p}$ at which it is tangent, i.e. $\pi(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{p}$. 
</MathBox>

In the special case $M = \R^n$, the tangent bundle of $\R^n$ can be canonically identified with the union of its geometric tangent spaces, which in turn is just the Cartesian product of $\R^n$ with itself:

$$
\begin{align*}
  T\R^n =& \bigsqcup_{\mathbf{a}\in\R^n} T_\mathbf{a}\R^n \cong \bigsqcup_{\mathbf{a}\in\R^n} \R_\mathbf{a}^n \\
  =& \bigsqcup_{\mathbf{a}\in\R^n} \Set{\mathbf{a}} \times\R^n = \R^n \times\R^n
\end{align*}
$$

An element $(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{v})\in T\R^n$ of this Cartesian product can be thought of as representing either the geometric tangent vector $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a}$ or the derivation $\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}$.

In general, the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold cannot be identified in any natural way with a Cartesian product, because there is no canonical way to identify tangent spaces at different points with each other.

<MathBox title='The tangent bundle is a smooth manifold' boxType='proposition'>
For any smooth $n$-manifold $M$, the tangent bundle $TM$ has a natural topology and smooth structure that make it into a $2n$-dimensional smooth manifold. With respect to this structure, the projection $\pi:TM\to M$ is smooth.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

$$
\begin{CD}
  \pi^{-1}(U) \subseteq TM @>\tilde{\varphi}>> @ \varphi(U)\times\R^n \subseteq \R^{2n} \\
  @V{\pi}VV @VVV \\
  U \subseteq M @>>\varphi> \varphi(U)\subseteq \R^n
\end{CD}
$$

Given any smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$, note that $\pi^{-1} (U)\subseteq TM$ is the set of all tangent vector to $M$ at all points of $U$. Let $(x^i)_{i=1}^n$ denote the coordinate functions of $\varphi$, and define a map $\tilde{\varphi}: \pi^{-1}(U)\to\R^{2n}$ by

$$
  \tilde{\varphi}\left(v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} \right) = \left(x^1(\mathbf{p}),\dots,x^n (\mathbf{p}),v^1,\dots,v^n \right)
$$

It image set is $\varphi(U)\times\R^n$ which is an open subset of $\R^{2n}$. It is a bijection onto its image, because its inverse can be written explicitly as

$$
  \tilde{\varphi}^{-1}(x^1,\dots,x^n,v^1,\dots,v^n) = v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_{\varphi^{-1}(\mathbf{x})}
$$

Suppose that we are given two smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ for $M$, and let $(\psi^{-1}(U), \tilde{\varphi})$ and $(\tilde^{-1}(V), \tilde{\psi})$ be the corresponding charts on $TM$. The sets

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{\varphi}\left(\pi^{-1}(U) \cap \pi^{-1}(V) \right) =& \varphi(U \cap V) \times\R^n \\
  \tilde{\psi}\left(\pi^{-1}(U) \cap \pi^{-1}(V) \right) =& \psi(U \cap V) \times\R^n
\end{align*}
$$

are open in $\R^{2n}$, and the transition map $\tilde{\psi}\circ\tilde{\varphi}^{-1}: \varphi(U\cap V)\times\R^n \to \psi(U\cap V)\times\R^n$ can be written as

$$
\begin{align*}
  &\tilde{psi}\circ\varphi^^{-1}(x^1,\dots,x^n,v^1,\dots,v^n) \\
  &= \left(\tilde{x}^1(\mathbf{x}),\dots,\tilde{x}^n(\mathbf{x}), \frac{\partial \tilde{x}^1}{\partial x^j}(\mathbf{x})v^j,\dots,\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^n}{\partial x^j}(\mathbf{x})v^j \right)
\end{align*}
$$

which is clearly smooth.

Choosing a countable cover $\Set{U_i}$ of $M$ by smooth coordinate domains, we obtain a countable cover of $TM$ by coordinate domains $\Set{\pi^{-1}(U_i)}$ satisfying the conditions of the smooth manifold chart lemma. To check the Hausdorff condition, note that any two points in the same fibre of $\pi$ lie in one chart, while if $(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{v})$ and $(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{w})$ lie in different fibers, there exits disjoint smooth coordinate domains $U$ and $V$ for $M$ such that $\mathbf{p}\in U$ and $\mathbf{q}\in V$, and then $\pi^{-1}(U)$ and $\pi^{-1}(V)$ are disjoint coordinate neighbourhoods containing $(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{v})$ and $(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{w})$, respectively.

To se that $\pi$ is smooth, note that with respect to the charts $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ and $(\pi^{-1}(U), \tilde{\varphi})$ for $TM$, its coordinate representation is $\pi(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{x}$.

If $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary, and $M$ can be covered by a single smooth chart, then $TM$ is diffeomorphic to $M\times\R^n$.

If $(U,\varphi)$ is a global smooth chart for $M$, then $\varphi$ is, in particular a diffeomorphism from $U = M$ to an open subset $\hat{U}\subseteq \R^n$ or $H^n$. The proof from the previous proposition showed that the natural coordinate chart $\tilde{\varphi}$ is a bijection from $TM$ for $\hat{U}\times\R^n$, and the smooth structure on $TM$ is defined essentially by declaring $\tilde{\varphi}$ to be a diffeomorphism.

Let $F:M\to N$ be a smooth map between smooth manifolds $M$ and $N$. By combining the differentials of $F$ at all points of $M$, we obtain a globally defined map $\mathrm{d}F: TM\to TN$ between tangent bundles, called the *global differential* or *global tangent map*. This is just the map whose restriction to each tangent space $T_\mathbf{p}M \subseteq TM$ is $\mathrm{d}F_p$.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>

From the local expression for $\mathrm{d}F_p$ in coordinates, it follows that $\mathrm{d}F$ has the following coordinate representation in terms of natural coordinates for $TM$ and $TN$:

This map is smooth, because $F$ is smooth.

## Velocity vectors of curves

<MathBox title='Curve and velocity' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ is a manifold with or without boundary, a *curve* in $M$ is a continuous map $\gamma: I\subseteq\R \to M$ where the interval $I\subseteq\R$ can be both open and closed.

If $\gamma$ is a smooth curve, the *velocity* of $\gamma$ at $t_0$ is defined as the tangent vector

$$
  \gamma'(t_0) = \mathrm{d}\gamma\left(\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t_0} \right) \in T_{\gamma(t_0)}M
$$

where $\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t_0}$ is the standard coordinate basis vector in $T_{t_0}\R$. This tangent vector acts on functions by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \gamma' (t_0)f =& \mathrm{d}\gamma\left(\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t_0} \right) = \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t_0} (f\circ\gamma) \\
  =& (f\circ\gamma)'(t_0)
\end{align*}
$$
</MathBox>

Let $(U,\varphi)$ be a smooth chart for a smooth $n$-manifold M with coordinate functions $(x^i)_{i=1}^n$. If $\gamma(t_0)\in U$, the coordinate representation of $\gamma$ is $\gamma(t) = (\gamma^i(t))_{i=1}^n$. The coordinate formula for the differential yields

$$
  \gamma'(t_0) = \frac{\mathrm{d}\gamma^i}{\mathrm{d}t}(t_0)\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_{\gamma(t_0)}
$$

This means that $\gamma'(t_0)$ is the tangent vector whose components in a coordinate basis are the derivatives of the component functions of $\gamma$.

<MathBox title='Tangent vectors are velocity vectors' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary and $\mathbf{p}\in M$. Every $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p}M$ is the velocity of some smooth curve in $M$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

First, suppose that $\mathbf{p}\in\mathrm{int}(M)$. Let $(U,\varphi)$ be a smooth coordinate chart centered at $\mathbf{p}$, and write $\mathbf{v} = v^i \boldsymbol{\partial}_i |_\mathbf{p}$ in terms of the coordinate basis. For sufficiently small $\varepsilon > 0$, let $\gamma(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \to U$ be the curve with coordinate representation

$$
  \gamma(t) = (tv^i)_{i=1}^n
$$

This is a smooth curve with $\gamma(0) = \mathbf{p}$, and from the coordinate represenation of $\gamma'$ we get $\gamma'(0) = v^i \boldsymbol{\partial}_i |_{\gamma(0)} = \mathbf{v}$.

Next, suppose that $\mathbf{p}\in\partial M$. In this case, $\gamma(t) = (tv^i)_{i=1}^n$ only represents a point in $M$ when $tv^n \geq 0$. We can accommadate this by suitably restricting the domain of $\gamma$:
- if $v^n = 0$, we define $\gamma:(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon)\to U$ as before
- if $v^n >0$, we let the domain be $[0, \varepsilon)$
- if $v^n < 0$, we let the domain be $(-\varepsilon, 0]$

In each case, $\gamma$ is a smooth curve in $M$ with $\gamma(0) = \mathbf{p}$ and $\gamma'(0) = \mathbf{v}$.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $F:M\to N$ be a smooth map, and let $\gamma:I\to M$ be a smooth curve. For any $t_0 \in I$, the velocity at $t = t_0$ of the composite curve $F\circ\gamma:I\to N$ is given by

$$
  (F\circ\gamma)'(t_0) = \mathrm{d}F(\gamma'(t_0))
$$

## Alternative definitions of the tangent space

### Derivations of the space of germs

<MathBox title='Germ' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. A *smooth function element* on $M$ is an ordered pair $(f,U)$ where $U$ is an open subset of $M$ and $f:U\to\R$ is a smooth function.

For two function elements, we define an equivalence relation $(f,U)\sim_\mathbf{p} (g, V)$ if $f \equiv g$ on some neighbourhood of a point $\mathbf{p}\in M$. The equivalence class of a function element $(f,U)$, denoted $[(f,U)]_\mathbf{p}$, is called the *germ* of $f$ at $\mathbf{p}$. The set of all germs of smooth functions at $\mathbf{p}$ is denoted $C_\mathbf{p}^\infty (M)$. It is a real vector space and an associative algebra under the operations

- **(scalar multiplication):** $c[(f,U)]_\mathbf{p} = [(cf, U)]_\mathbf{p}$
- **(addition):** $[(f,U)]_\mathbf{p} + [(f + g, U\cap V)]_\mathbf{p}$
- **(multiplication):** $[(f,U)]_\mathbf{p} \cdot [(g,V)]_\mathbf{p} = [(fg, U\cap V)]$

A *derivation* of $C_\mathbf{p}^\infty$ is a linear map $v:C_\mathbf{p}^\infty (M) \to\R$ satisfying the product rule

$$
  v[fg]_\mathbf{p} = f(\mathbf{p})v[g]_\mathbf{p} + g(\mathbf{p})v[f]_\mathbf{p}
$$
</MathBox>

It is common to define the tangent space to $M$ at $\mathbf{p}$ as the vector space $D_\mathbf{p} M$ of derivations of $C_\mathbf{p}^\infty(M)$. The map $\phi: D_\mathbf{p}M \to T_\mathbf{p} M$ defined by $(\varphi\mathbf{v})f = \mathbf{v}([f]_\mathbf{p})$ is an isomorphism.

### Equivalence classes of curves

<MathBox title='Tangent space' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional smooth manifold and let $p\in M$. The set of all curves in $M$ passing through $p$ is defined as

$$
  C_p (M) := \Set{ \gamma:(-\varepsilon, \epsilon) \to M | \gamma \textrm{ differentiable } \gamma(0) = p }
$$

For any chart $h: U\subseteq M \to\R^n$ there is an equivalence relation

$$
  \gamma\sim\alpha :\iff (h\circ\gamma)'(0) = (h\circ\alpha)'(0)
$$

The equivalence class $[\gamma]_\sim := \Set{\alpha | \gamma\sim\alpha }$ represents a tangent vector. The tangent space of $M$ at $p$, denoted $T_p M$ is defined as the set of all tangent vectors at $p$

$$
  T_p M := C_p(M)/\sim
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Coordinate basis' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional smooth manifold having a chart $h:U\subseteq M \to \R^n$ with inverse $\phi = h^{-1}$. Since the tangent space $T_p M$ is isomorphic to $\R^n$ there is a linear and bijective map $h_* : T_p M \to \R^n$ given by $[\gamma]\mapsto (h\circ\gamma)'(0)$ where the equivalence class $[\gamma]$ is a tangent vector in $T_p M$. The coordinate basis with respect to $h$ is defined as

$$
  \partial_j := \phi_* (e_j)
$$

where $\phi_* := h_*^{-1}$ and $(e_i)_{i=1}^n$ is the standard basis of $\R^n$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Differential' boxType='definition'>
Let $M, N$ be two smooth manifolds and let $f:M\to N$ be a smooth function. The differential of $f$ at $p\in M$ is defined as

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}f_p:& T_p M \to T_{f(p)} \\
  & [\gamma] \mapsto [f\circ\gamma]
\end{align*}
$$

The differential of $f$ is defined as

$$
  \mathrm{d}f: p\mapsto\mathrm{d}f_p
$$
</MathBox>

### Tangent space

<MathBox title='Tangent spaces of submanifolds' boxType='definition'>
Let $M\subseteq\R^n$ be a $k$-dimensional submanifold. Then there is a chart $(U, h)$ of $\R^n$ such that

$$
  h(M\cap U) = \left( \R^k \times \mathbf{0}_{n-k} \right) \cap U'
$$

Since $h$ is a homemorphism, we may form an inverse $\phi: \R^k \cap U \to M\cap U$ giving a local parametrization. The tangent space for $p\in M$ is defined as

$$
  \mathrm{T}_p M := \mathrm{d}\phi_{\tilde{p}} [\R^k] = \Set{ J_\phi \left( \phi^{-1}(p)x \right) | x\in\R^k } \subseteq\R^n 
$$

The tangent space can be reformulated in terms of a parametrized curve $\gamma:\R\to M$

$$
  \mathrm{T}_p M = \Set{ \gamma'(0) | \gamma:(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \to M \textrm{ differentiable with } \gamma(0) = p }
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

To prove the reformulation, first let $v \in \mathrm{T}_p M$ such that $v = J_\phi\left(\tilde{p} \right)x$ with $\tilde{p} = \phi^{-1}(p)$ and $x\in\R^k$. Then for $\tilde{\gamma}(t) = \tilde{p} + tx$

$$
\begin{align}
  v &= J_\phi \left(\tilde{\gamma}(0) right)\tilde{\gamma}(0) \\
  &= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\gamma \circ \tilde{\gamma} \right)|_{t=0} = \gamma'
\end{align}
$$

This shows that $T_p M \subseteq \Set{ \gamma'(0) | \gamma:(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \to M \textrm{ differentiable with } \gamma(0) = p }$

Finally, let $\gamma: (-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \to M$ differentiable with $\gamma (0) = p$. Since $M$ is a submanifold, there is a chart $h: U\cap M \to \R^k \cap U'$, which defines an inverse of $\phi$. Define $x:= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} (h \circ \gamma)|_{t=0}$ so that $\tilde{\gamma} = h\circ \gamma$. Then

$$
\begin{align}
  \gamma'(0) &= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\phi \circ \gamma)\right)|_{t=0} \\
  &= J_\phi \left(\tilde{\gamma}(0) \right)\tilde{\gamma}'(0) = J_\phi \left(\phi^{-1}(p)\right)x
\end{align}
$$

This shows that $T_p M \supseteq \Set{ \gamma'(0) | \gamma:(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \to M \textrm{ differentiable with } \gamma(0) = p }$

# Submersions, immersions and embeddings

<MathBox title='Rank' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary. Given a smooth map $F:M\to N$ and a point $\mathbf{p}\in M$, we define the *rank* of $F$ at $\mathbf{p}$ to be the rank of the linear map $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}:T_\mathbf{p}M \to T_{F(\mathbf{p})}N$, which is the rank of the Jacobian matrix of $F$ in any smooth smooth chart, or the dimension of $\mathrm{ran}(\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}) \subseteq T_{F(\mathbf{p})} N$. 

The rank of $F$ at each point bounded above by $\min\Set{\dim(M),\dim(N)}$. If the rank of $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is equal to this upper bound, then $F$ has full rank at $\mathbf{p}$, and if $F$ has full rank everywhere, we say that $F$ has *full rank*. If $F$ has the same rank at every point, we say that is has constant rank.

A smooth map $F:M\to N$ is called a *smooth submersion* if its differential is surjective at each point, i.e. $\mathrm{rank}(F) = \dim(N)$. It is called a *smooth immersion* if its differential is injective at each point, i.e. $\mathrm{rank}(F) = \dim(M)$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map and $\mathbf{p}\in M$. If $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is surjective, then $\mathbf{p}$ has a neighbourhood $U$ such that $F|_U$ is a submersion. If $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is injective, then $\mathbf{p}$ has a neighbourhood $U$ such that $F|_U$ is an immersion.

<details>

If we choose any smooth coordinate for $M$ near $\mathbf{p}$ and for $N$ near $F(\mathbf{p})$, either hypothesis mean that the Jacobian matrix of $F$ in coordinates has full rank at $\mathbf{p}$. If $\dim(M)= m$ and $\dim(N) = n$, the set of $m\times n$ matrices of full rank is an open subset of $\mathcal{M}_{m,n}(\mathbb{R})$. By continuity, the Jacobian of $F$ has full rank in some neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$.

## Local diffeomorphism

If $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, a map $F:M\to N$ is called a *local diffeomorphism* if every point $p\in M$ has a neighbourhood $U$ such that $F(U)$ is open in $N$ and $F|_U:U\to F(U)$ is a diffeomorphism.

<MathBox title='Inverse function theorem for manifolds' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that  $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds, and let $F:M\to N$ be a smooth map. If $\mathbf{p}\in M$ is a point such that $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is invertible, then there are connected neighbourhoods $U_0$ of $\mathbf{p}$ and $V_0$ of $F(\mathbf{p})$ such that $F|_U:U_0 \to V_0$ is a diffeomorphism.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The fact that $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is bijective implies that $M$ and $N$ have the same dimension, say $n$. Choose smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$ and $(V,\psi)$ centered at $F(\mathbf{p})$ with $F(U) \subseteq V$. Then $\tilde{F} = \psi\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is a smooth map from the open subset $\tilde{U} = \varphi(U)\subseteq\R^n$ into $\tilde{V} = \psi(V)\subseteq\R^n$ with $\tilde{F}(\mathbf{p}) = 0$. Because $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are diffeomorphisms, the differential $\mathrm{d}\tilde{F}_0 = \mathrm{d}_{\psi_{F(\mathbf{p})}} \circ \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p} \circ \mathrm{d}(\varphi^{-1})_0$ is nonsingular. The ordinary inverse function theorem shows that there are connected open subsets $\tilde{U}_0 \subseteq\tilde{U}$ and $\tilde{V}_0 \subseteq\tilde{V}$ containing $0$ such that $\tilde{F}$ restricts to a diffeomorphism from $\tilde{U}_0$ to $\tilde{V}_0$. Then $U_0 = \varphi^{-1} (\tilde{U}_0)$ and $V_0 = \psi^{-1}(\tilde{V}_0)$ are connected neighbourhoods of $\mathbf{p}$ and $F(\mathbf{p})$, respectively, and it follows by composition that $F|_{U_0}$ is a diffeomorphism from $U_0$ to $V_0$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Suppose first that $F$ is a local diffeomorphism. Given $\mathbf{p}\in M$ there is a neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{p}$ such that $F$ is a diffeomorphism from $U$ to $F(U)$. It follows that $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}:T_\mathbf{p}M\to T_{F(\mathbf{p})} N$ is an isomorphism. Thus, $\mathrm{rank}(F) = \dim(M) = \dim(N)$, so $F$ is both a smooth immersion and a smooth submersion.

Conversely, if $F$ is both a smooth immersion and a smooth submersion, then $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is an isomorphism at each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, and the inverse function theorem for manifolds shows that $\mathbf{p}$ has a neighbourhood on which $F$ restricts to a diffeomorphism onto its image.

**(2):** Note that if $M$ and $N$ have the same dimension, then either injectivity or surjectivity of $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ implies bijectivity, so $F$ is a smooth submersion if and only if it is a smooth immersion, and thus **(2)** follows from **(1)**.

Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds of dimensions $m$ and $n$, respectively, and that $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map with constant rank $\mathrm{rank}(F) = r$. For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, there exists smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$ and $(V,\psi)$ for $N$ centered at $F(\mathbf{p})$ such that $F(U) \subseteq V$, in which $F$ has a coordinate representation of the form

$$
  \tilde{F}(x^1,\dots,x^r,x^{r+1},\dots,x^m) = (x^1,\dots,x^r,0,\dots,0)

In particular, if $F$ is a smooth submersion, this becomes

$$
  \tilde{F}(x^1,\dots,x^n,x^{n+1},\dots,x^m) = (x^1,\dots,x^n)
$$

and if $F$ is a smooth immersion, it is

$$
  \tilde{F}(x^1,\dots,\dots,x^m) = (x^1,\dots,x^m,0,\dots,0)
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Because the theorem is local, after choosing smooth coordinates we can replace $M$ and $N$ by open subsets $U\subseteq\R^m$ and $V\subseteq\R^n$. The fact that $\mathrm{D}F(\mathbf{p})$ has rank $r$ implies that its matrix has some $r\times r$ submatrix with nonzero determinant. By reordering the coordinates, we may assume that it is the upper left submatrix, $\left(\frac{\partial F^i}{\partial x^j}\right)$ for $i,j=1,\dots,r$. 

Let us relabel the standard coordinates as $(x, y) = (x^1,\dots,x^r, y^1,\dots,y^{m-r})$ in $\R^n$ and $(v,w) = (v^1,\dots,v^r,w^1,\dots,w^{n-r})$ in $\R^n$. By initial translations of the coordinates, we may assume without loss of generality that $\mathbf{p} = (0, 0)$ and $F(\mathbf{p}) = (0,0)$. If we write $F(x,y) = (Q(x,y), R(x,y))$ for some smooth maps $Q: U\to\R^r$ and $R:U\to\R^{n-r}$, then our hypothesis is that $\left(\frac{\partial Q^i}{\partial x^j}\right)$ is nonsingular at $(0,0)$.

Define $\varphi:U\to\R^m$ by $\varphi(x,y) = (Q(x,y), y)$. Its total derivative at $(0,0)$ is

$$
  \mathrm{D}\varphi(0,0) = \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial Q^i}{\partial x^j}(0,0) & \frac{\partial Q^i}{\partial y^j}(0,0) \\
    0 & \delta_j^i
  \end{bmatrix}
$$

The matrix $\mathrm{D}\varphi(0,0)$ is nonsingular by virtue of the hypothesis. Thus, by the inverse function theorem, there are connected neighbourhoods $U_0$ of $(0,0)$ and $\tilde{U}_0$ of $\varphi(0,0) = (0,0)$ such that $\varphi:U_0\to\tilde{U}_0$ is a diffeomorphism. By shrinking $U_0$ and $\tilde{U}_0$ if necessary, we may assume that $\tilde{U}_0$ is an open cube. Writing the inverse map as $\varphi^{-1}(x,y) = (A(x,y), B(x,y))$ for some smooth functions $A:\tilde{U}_0 \to \R^r$ and $B:\tilde{U}_0 \to\R^{m-r}$, we get

$$
\begin{align*}
  (x,y) =& \varphi(A(x,y), B(x,y)) \\
  =& (Q(A(x,y), B(x,y)), B(x,y))
\end{align*}
$$

Comparing $y$ components shows that $B(x,y) = y$ and therefore $\varphi^{-1}$ has the form

$$
  \varphi^{-1}(x,y) = (A(x,y),y)
$$

On the other hand, $\varphi\circ\varphi^{-1} = \mathrm{id}$ implies that $Q(A(x,y),y)$ = x, and therefore $F\circ\varphi^{-1}$ has the form

$$
  F\circ\varphi^{-1}(x,y) = (x, \tilde{R}(x,y))
$$

where $\tilde{R}:\tilde{U}_0 \to\R^{n-r}$ is defined by $\tilde{R}(x,y) = R(A(x,y), y)$. The Jacobian matrix fo this composite map at an arbitrary point $(x,y)\in\tilde{U}$ is

$$
  \mathrm{D}(F\circ \varphi^{-1})(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}
    \delta_j^i & 0 \\
    \frac{\partial\tilde{R}^i}{\partial x^j}(x,y) & \frac{\partial\tilde{R}^i}{\partial y^j} (x,y)
  \end{bmatrix}
$$

Since composing with a diffeomorphism does not change the rank of a map, this matrix has rank $r$ everywhere in $\tilde{U}_0$. The first $r$ columns are obviously linearly independent, so the rank can be $r$ on if the derivatives $\frac{\partial\tilde{R}^i}{\partial y^j}$ vanish identically on $\tilde{U}_0$, which implies that $\tilde{R}$ is independent of $(y^1,\dots,y^{m-r})$. Thus, if we let $S(x) = \tilde{R}(x,0)$, then we have

$$
  F\circ\varphi^{-1}(x,y) = (x, S(x))
$$

To complete the proof, we need to define an appropriate smooth chart in some neighbourhood of $(0,0)\in V$. Let $V_0 \subseteq V$ be the open subset defined by $V_0 = \Set{(v,w)\in V | (v,0)\in\tilde{U}_0}$. Then $V_0$ is a neighbourhood of $(0,0)$. Because $\tilde{U}_0$ is a cube and $F\circ\varphi^{-1}$ has the form above, it follows that $F\circ \varphi^{-1}(\tilde{U}_0) \subseteq V_0$, and therefore $F(U_0)\subseteq V_0$. Define $\psi:V_0 \to\R^n$ by $\psi(v,w) = (v, w - S(v))$. This is a diffeomorphism onto its image, because its inverse is given explicitly by $\psi^{-1}(s,t) = (s,t + S(s))$. Thus, $(V_0, \psi)$ is a smooth chart. It follows that 

$$
\begin{align*}
  \psi\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1} (x,y) =& \psi(x, S(x)) \\
  =& (x, S(x) - S(x)) = (x,0)
\end{align*}
$$

which was to be proved.

Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifold, let $F:M\to N$ be a smooth map, and suppose that $M$ is connected. Then the following are equivalent:
1. For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$ there exist smooth charts containing $\mathbf{p}$ and $F(\mathbf{p})$ in which the coordinate representation of $F$ is linear.
2. $F$ has constant rank

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

First, suppose that $F$ has a linear coordinate representation in a neighbourhood of each point. Since every linear map has constant rank, it follows that the rank of $F$ is constant in a neighbourhood of each point, and thus by connectedness it is constant on all of $M$. Conversely, if $F$ has constant rank, the rank theorem shows that it has the linear coordinate representation in a neighbourhood of each point.

3. if $F$ is bijective, then it is a diffeomorphism

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\dim(M) = m$ and $\dim(N) = n$, and suppose $\mathrm{rank}(F) = r$ is constant.

**(1):** Assume that $F$ is not a smooth submersion, which means that $r < n$. By the rank theorem, for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$ there are smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$ and $(V,\psi)$ for $N$ centered at $F(\mathbf{p})$ such that $F(U) \subseteq V$ and the coordinate representation of $F$ is given by the rank theorem, Shrinking $U$ if necessary, we may assume that it is a regular coordinate ball and $F(\overline(U))\subseteq V$. This implies that $F(\overline{U})$ is a compact subset of the set $\Set{y\in V | y^{r+1} = \cdots = y^n = 0}$, so it is closed in $N$ and contains no open subset of $N$; hence it is nowhere dense in $N$. Since very open cover of a manifold has a countable subcover, we can choose countably many such charts $\Set{(U_i,\varphi_i)}$ covering $M$, with corresponding charts $\Set{(V_i,\psi_i)}$ covering $F(M)$. Because $F(M)$ is equal to the countable union of the nowhere dense sets $F(\overline{U}_i)$, it follows from the Baire category theorem that $F(M)$ has empty interior in $N$, meaning that $F$ cannot be surjective.

**(2):** Asuume that $F$ is not a smooth immersion, so that $r < m$. By the rank theorem, for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$ we can choose charts on neighbourhoods of $\mathbf{p}$ and $F(\mathbf{p})$ in which $F$ has the coordinate representation given by the rank theorem. It follows that $F(0,\dots,0,\varepsilon) = F(0,\dots,0,0)$ for any sufficiently small $\varepsilon$, so $F$ is not injective.

**(3):**  This follows from **(1)** and **(2)**, because a bijective smooth map of constant rank is a smooth submersion by part **(1)** and a smooth immersion by part **(2)**. It follows that $F$ is a local diffeomorphism, and because it is bijective, it is a diffeomorphism.

### Rank theorem for manifolds with boundary

<MathBox title='Local immersion theorem for manifolds with boundary' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth $m$-manifold with boundary, $N$ is a smooth $n$-manifold, and $F:M\to N$ is a smooth immersion. For any $\mathbf{p}\in\partial M$, there exist a smooth boundary chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ centered at $p$ and a smooth coordinate chart $(V,\psi)$ for $N$ centered at $F(\mathbf{p})$ with $F(U)\subseteq V$, in which $F$ has the coordinate representation

$$
  \hat{F}(x^1,\dots,x^m) = (x^1,\dots,x^m,0,\dots,0)
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

By choosing initial smooth charts for $M$ and $N$, we may assume that $M$ and $N$ are open subsets of $H^m$ and $\R^n$, respectively, and also that $\mathbf{p} = 0 \in H^m$ and $F(\mathbf{p}) = 0\in\R^n$. By definition os smoothness for functions on $H^m$, it follows that $F$ extends to a smooth map $\tilde{F}:W\to\R^n$, where $W$ is some open subset of $\R^m$ containing $0$. Because $\mathrm{d}\tilde{F}_0 = \mathrm{d}F_0$ is injective, by shrinking $W$ if necessary, we may assume that $\tilde{F}$ is a smooth immersion. Let us write coordintes on $\R^m$ as $x = (x^i)_{i=1}^m$ and those on $\R$ as $(v,w) = (v^1,0\dots,v^m, w^1,\dots,w^{n-m})$.

By the rank theorem, there exist smooth charts $(U_0, \varphi_0)$ for $\R^m$ centered at $0$ and $(V_0,\psi_0)$ for $\R^n$ centered at $0$ such that $\hat{F} = \psi_0 \circ\tilde{F}\circ\varphi_0^{-1}$ is given by the coordinate representation in the hypothesis. The only problem with these coordinates is that $\varphi_0$ might not restrict to a boundary chart for $M$. But we can correct this easily as follow. 

Because $\varphi_0$ is a diffeomorphism from $U_0$ to an open subset $\hat{U}_0 = \psi_0(U_0)\subseteq\R^m$, the map $\varphi_0^{-1} \times\mathrm{id}_{\R^{n-m}}$ is a diffeomorphism from $\tilde{U}_0 \times\R^{n-m}$ to $U_0 \times\R^{n-m}$. Let $\psi = (\varphi_0^{-1} \times \mathrm{id}_{\R^{n-m}}) \circ\varphi_0$, which is a diffeomorphism from some open subset $V\subseteq V_0$ containing $0$ to a neighbourhood of $0$ in $\R^n$. Using the hypothesis coordinate representation, we compute

$$
\begin{align*}
  \psi\circ F(x) =& \left(\varphi_0^{-1} \times\mathrm{id}_{\R^{n-m}} \right) \circ\varphi_0 \circ F \circ\varphi_0^{-1} \circ\varphi_0(x) \\
  =& \left(\varphi_0^{-1} \times\mathrm{id}_{\R^{n-m}} \right) \circ \hat{F}(\varphi_0(x)) \\
  =& \left(\varphi_0^{-1} \times\mathrm{id}_{\R^{n-m}} \right)(\varphi(x),0) = (x,0)
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the original coordinates for $M$ (restricted to a sufficiently small neighbourhood of $0$) and the chart $(V,\psi)$ for $N$ satisfy the desired conditions.

## Embeddings

<MathBox title='Smooth embedding' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, a *smooth embedding* of $M$ into $N$ is a smooth immersion $F:M\to N$ that is also a topological embedding, i.e. a homeomorphism onto its image $F(M)\subseteq N$ in the subspace topology. A smooth embedding is a map that is both a topological embedding and a smooth immersion.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and let $F:M\to N$ be an injective smooth immersion. If any of the following holds, then $F$ is a smooth embedding.
1. $F$ is an open or closed map
2. $F$ is a proper map
3. $M$ is compact
4. $M$ has empty boundary and $\dim(M) = \dim(N)$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1)**, **(2)** and **(3)** follow from properties of topological embeddings.

**(4):** If $M$ has empty boundary and $\dim(M) = \dim(N)$, then $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is nonsingular everywhere, and it follows that $F(M) \subseteq \mathrm{int}(N)$. Since $F:M\to\mathrm{int}(N)$ is a local diffeomorphism, it is an open map. It follows that $F:M\to N$ is a composition of open maps $M\to \mathrm{int}(N)\hookrightarrow N$, so it is an embedding.

<MathBox title='Local embedding theorem' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map. Then $F$ is a smooth immersion if and only if every point in $M$ has a neighbourhood $U\subseteq M$ such that $F|_U:U\to N$ is a smooth embedding.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

One direction is immediate: if every point has a neighbourhood on which $F$ is a smooth embedding, then $F$ has full rank everywhere, making it a smooth immersion.

Conversely, suppose that $F$ is a smooth immersion, and let $\mathbf{p}\in M$. We show first that $\mathbf{p}$ has a neighbourhood on which $F$ is injective. If $F(\mathbf{p}) \notin\partial N$, then either the rank theorem (if $\mathbf{p}\notin\partial M$) or the local immersion theorem (if $\mathbf{p}\in\partial M$) implies that there is a neighbourhood $U_1$ on $\mathbf{p}$ on which $F$ has a coordinate representation from the rank theorem. It follows from this formula that $F|_{U_1}$ is injective.

On the other hand, suppose that $F(\mathbf{p})\in\partial N$ and let $(W,\psi)$ be any smooth boundary chart for $N$ centered at $F(\mathbf{p})$. If we let $U_0 = F^{-1}(W)$, which is a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$, and let $\iota:H^n \to\R^n$ be the inclusion map, then the preceeding argument can be applied to the composite map $\iota\circ\psi\circ F|_{U_0}: U_0 \to\R^n$ to show that $\mathbf{p}$ has a neighbourhood $U_1 \subseteq U_0$ such that $\iota\circ\psi\circ F|_{U_1}$ is injective, from which it follows that $F|_{U_1}$ is injective.

Let $\mathbf{p}\in M$ be arbitray, and let $U_1$ be a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ on which $F$ is injective. There exists a precompact neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{p}$ such that $\overline{U}\subseteq U_1$. The restriction of $F$ to $\overline{U}$ is an injective continuous map with compact domain, so it is a topological embedding by the closed map lemma. Because any restriction of a topological embedding is again a topological embedding, $F|_U$ is both a topological embedding and a smooth immersion, hence a smooth embedding.

## Submersions

<MathBox title='Section' boxType='definition'>
If $\pi:M\to N$ is any continuous map, a *section* of $\pi$ is a continuous right inverse for $\pi$, i.e. a continuous map $\sigma:N\to M$ such that $\pi\circ\sigma = \mathrm{id}_N$.

A *local section* of $\pi$ is a continuous map $\sigma:U\to M$ defined on some open subset $U\subseteq N$ and satisfying the analogous relation $\pi\circ\sigma = \mathrm{id}_U$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Local section theorem' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds, and let $\pi:M\to N$ be a smooth map. Then $\pi$ is a smooth submersion if and only if every point of $M$ is in the image of a smooth local section of $\pi$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\dim(M) = m$ and $\dim(N) = n$. 

First, suppose that $\pi$ is a smooth submersion. Given $\mathbf{p}\in M$, let $\mathbf{q} = \pi(\mathbf{p})\in N$. By the rank theorem, we can chose smooth coordinates $(x^i)_{i=1}^m$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$ and $(y^j)_{j=1}^n$ centered at $\mathbf{q}$ in which $\pi$ has the coordinate representation

$$
  \pi(x^1,\dots,x^n,x^{n+1},\dots,x^m) = (x^1,\dots,x^n)
$$

If $\varepsilon > 0$ is sufficiently small, the coordinate cube

$$
  C_\varepsilon = \Set{x: \lvert x^i \rvert < \varepsion, i=1,\dots,m}
$$

is a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ whose image under $\pi$ is the cube

$$
  C'_\varepsilon = \Set{y: \lvert y^i \rvert < \varepsilon, i=1,\dots,m}
$$

The map $\sigma: C'_\varepsilon \to C_\varepsilon$ whose coordinate representation is

$$
  \sigma(x^1,\dots,x^n) = (x^1,\dots,x^n,0,\dots,0)
$$

is a smooth local section of $\pi$ satisfying $\sigma(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{p}$.

Conversely, assume that each point of $M$ is in the image of a smooth local section. Given $\mathbf{p}\in M$, let $\sigma:U\to M$ be a smooth local section such that $\sigma(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{p}$, where $\mathbf{q} = \pi(\sigma(\mathbf{q})) = \pi(\mathbf{p})\in N$. The equation $\pi\circ\sigma = \mathrm{id}_U$ implies that $\mathrm{d}\pi_\mathbf{p} \circ \mathrm{d}\sigma_\mathbf{q} = \mathrm{id}_{T_\mathbf{q} N}$, which in turn implies that $\mathrm{d}\pi_\mathbf{p}$ is surjective.

<MathBox title='Properties of smooth submersions' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds, and let $\pi:M\to N$ be a smooth submersion. Then $\pi$ is an open map, and if it is surjective it is a quotient map.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $W$ is an open subset of $M$ and $\mathbf{q}$ is a point of $\pi(W)$. For any $\mathbf{p}\in W$ such that $\pi(\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{q}$, there is a neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{q}$ on which there exists a smooth local section $\sigma:U\to M$ of $\pi$ satisfying $\sigma(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{p}$. For each $\mathbf{y}\in \sigma^{-1}(W)$, the fact that $\sigma(\mathbf{y})\in W$ implies $\mathbf{y} = \pi(\sigma(\mathbf{y}))\in \pi(W)$. Thus $\sigma^{-1}(W)$ is a neighbourhood of $q$ contained in $\pi(W)$, which implies that $\pi(W)$ is open. The second assertion follows from the first because every surjective open continuous map is a quotient map.

Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds, and let $\pi:M\to N$ be a surjective smooth submersion. For any smooth manifold $P$ with or without boundary, a map $F:N\to P$ is smooth if and only if $F\circ\pi$ is smooth

$$
\begin{CD}
  M @>{F\circ\pi}>> P \\

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $F$ is smooth, then $F\circ\pi$ is smooth by composition. Conversely, suppose that $F\circ\pi$ is smooth, and let $\mathbf{q}\in N$ be arbitrary. Since $\pi$ is surjective, there is a point $\mathbf{p}\in\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{q})$, and then the local section theorem guarantees the existence of a neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{q}$ and a smooth local section $\sigma:U\to M$ of $\pi$ such that $\sigma(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{p}$. Then $\pi\circ\sigma = \mathrm{id}_U$ implies

$$
\begin{align*}
  F|_U =& F|_U \circ \mathrm{id}_U \\
  =& F|_U \circ (\pi\circ\sigma) \\
  =& (F\circ\pi)\circ\sigma
\end{align*}
$$

which is a composition of smooth maps. This shows that $F$ is smooth in a neighbourhood of each point, so it is smooth.

If $P$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary and $F:M\to P$ is a smooth map that is constant on the fibers of $\pi$, then there exists a unique smooth map $\tilde{F}:N\to P$ such that $\tilde{F}\circ\pi = F$

Since a surjective smooth submersion is a quotient map, the passing to the quotient theorem, shows that there exists a unique continuous map $\tilde{F}:N\to P$ satisfying $\tilde{F}\circ\pi = F$, which is mooth by the characteristic property of surjective smooth submersions.

## Smooth covering maps

<MathBox title='Smooth covering map' boxType='definition'>
If $E$ and $M$ are connected smooth manifolds with or without boundary, a map $\pi:E\to M$ is called a *smooth covering map* if $\pi$ is smooth and surjective, and point in $M$ has a neighbourhood $U$ such that each component of $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is mapped diffeomorphically onto $U$ by $\pi$. In this context, we say that $U$ is *evenly covered*. The space $M$ is called the *base of the covering*, and $E$ is called a *covering manifold* of $M$. If $E$ is simply connected, it is called the *universal covering manifold of* $M$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of smooth coverings' boxType='proposition'>
1. Every smooth covering map is a local diffeomorphism, a smooth submersion, an open map, and a quotient map.
2. An injective smooth covering map is a diffeomorphism.

diffeomorphism.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Local section theorem for smooth covering maps' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $E$ and $M$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and let $\pi:E\to M$ be a smooth covering map. Given any evenly covered open subsets $U\subseteq M$, any $\mathbf{q}\in U$ and any $\mathbf{p}$ in the fibre of $\pi$ over $\mathbf{q}$, there exists a unique smooth local section $\sigma:U\to E$ such that $\sigma(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{p}$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\tilde{U}_0$ be the component of $\pi^{-1}(U)$ containing $\mathbf{p}$. Since the restriction of $\pi$ to $U_0$ is a diffeomorphism onto $U$, the map $\sigma = \left(\pi|_{\tilde{U}_0}\right)^{-1}$ is the required smooth local section.

To prove uniqueness, suppose that $\sigma':U\to E$ is any other smooth local section satisfying $\sigma'(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{p}$. Since $U$ is connected, $\sigma'(U)$ is contained in the component $\tilde{U}_0$ containing $\mathbf{p}$. Because $\sigma'$ is a right inverse for the bijective map $\pi|_{\tilde{U}_0}$, it must be equal to its inverse, and therefore equal to $\sigma$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Covering spaces of smooth manifolds' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a connected smooth $n$-manifold, and let $\pi:E\to M$ be a topological covering map. Then $E$ is a topological $n$-manifold, and has a unique smooth structure such that $\pi$ is a smooth covering map.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Because $\pi$ is a local homeomorphism, $E$ is locally Euclidean. 

**$E$ is Hausdorff**<br/>
To show that it is Hausdorff, let $\mathbf{p}_1$ and $\mathbf{p}_2$ be distinct points in $E$. If $\varphi(\mathbf{p}_1) = \pi(\mathbf{p}_2)$ and $U\subseteq M$ is an evenly covered subset containing $\pi(\mathbf{p}_1)$, then the components of $\pi^{-1}(U)$ containing $\mathbf{p}_1$ and $\mathbf{p}_2$ are disjoint open subsets of $E$ that separate $\mathbf{p}_1$ and $\mathbf{p}_2$.

On the other hand, if $\pi(\mathbf{p}_1) \neq\pi(\mathbf{p}_2)$, there are disjoint open subsets $U_1, U_2 \subseteq M$ containing $\pi(\mathbf{p}_1)$ and $\pi(\mathbf{p}_2)$, respectively, and then $\pi^{-1}(U_1)$ and $\pi^{-1}(U_2)$ are disjoint open subsets of $E$ containing $\mathbf{p}_1$ and $\mathbf{p}_2$. Thus, $E$ is Hausdorff.

**$E$ is second-countable**<br/>
To show that $E$ is second-countable, we will first show that each fiber of $\pi$ is countable. Given $\mathbf{q}\in M$ and and arbitrary point $\mathbf{p}_0 \in\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{q})$, we will construct a surjective map $\beta: \pi(M,\mathbf{q})\to\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{q})$. This suffices since $\pi_1(M, \mathbf{q})$ is countable by the fundamental group property.

Let $[f]\in\pi_1(M,\mathbf{q})$ be the class of an arbitrary loop $f:[0,1]\to M$ based at $\mathbf{q}$. The path-lifting property of covering maps guarantees that there is a lift $\tilde{f}:[0,1]\to E$ of $f$ starting at $\mathbf{p}_0$, and the monodromy theorem shows that the endpoint $\tilde{f}(1) \in\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{q})$ depends only on the path class of $f$, so it makes sense to define $\beta[f] = \tilde{f}(1)$. To see that $\beta$ is surjective, just note that for any point $\mathbf{p}\in\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{q})$, there is a path $\tilde{f}$ in $E$ from $\mathbf{p}_0$ to $\mathbf{p}$, and then $f = \pi\circ\tilde{f}$ is a loop in $M$ such that $\mathbf{p} = \beta[f]$.

The collection of all evenly covered open subset is an open cover of $M$, and therefore has a countable subcover $\Set{U_i}$. For any given $i$, each component of $\pi^{-1}(U_i)$ contains exactly one point in each fibre oover $U_i$, so $\pi^{-1}(U_i)$ has countably many components. The collection of all components of all sets of the form $\pi^{-1}(U_i)$ is thus a countable open cover of $E$. Since each such component is second-countble, it follows that $E$ is second-countable. This completes the proof that $E$ is a topological manifold.

**Smooth structure on $E$**<br/>
To construct a smooth structure on $E$, suppose $\mathbf{p}$ is any point in $E$, and let $U$ be an evenly covered neighbourhood of $\pi(\mathbf{p})$. After shrinking $U$ if necessary, we may assume also that it is the domain of a smooth coordinate map $\varphi:U\to\R^n$. If $\tilde{U}$ is the component of $\pi^{-1}(U)$ containing $\mathbf{p}$, and $\tilde{\varphi} = \varphi\circ\pi|_{\tilde{U}}: \tilde{U}\to\R^n$, then $(\tilde{U},\tilde{\varphi})$ is a chart on $E$. If two such charts $(\tilde{U},\tilde{\varphi})$ and $(\tilde{V},\tilde{\psi})$ overlap, the transition map can be written

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{\psi}\circ\tilde{\varphi}^{-1} =& \left(\psi\circ\pi|_{\tilde{U}\cap\tilde{V}} \right) \circ \left(\varphi\circ\pi|_{\tilde{U}\cap\tilde{V}} \right)^{-1} \\
  =& \psi\circ(\pi|_{\tilde{U}\cap\tilde{V}})\circ(\pi|_{\tilde{U}\cap\tilde{V}})^{-1}\circ\varphi^{-1} \\
  =& \psi\circ\varphi^{-1}
\end{align*}
$$

which is smooth. Thus, the collection of all such charts defines a smooth structure on $E$, which is unique.

Finally, $\pi$ is a smooth covering map because its coordinate representation in terms of any pair of charts $(\tilde{U},\tilde{\varphi})$ and $(U,\varphi)$ constructed above is the identity.

If $M$ is a connected smooth manifold, there exists a simply coneected smooth manifold $\tilde{M}$, called the *universal covering manifold* of $M$, and a smooth covering map $\pi:\tilde{M}\to M$. The universal covering manifold is unique in the following sense: if $\tilde{M}$ is any other simply connected smooth manifold that admits a smooth covering map $\pi': \tilde{M}'\to M$, then there exists a diffeomorphism $\pi:\tilde{M}\to\tilde{M}'$ such that $\pi'\circ\phi = \pi$.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $E$ and $M$ are nonempty connected smooth manifolds with or without boundary. If $\pi:E\to M$ is a proper local diffeomorphism, then $\pi$ is a smooth covering map.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Because $\pi$ is a local diffeomorphism, it is an open map, and because it is proper, it is a closed map. Thus, $\pi(E)$ is both open and closed in $M$. Since it is obviously nonempty, it is all of $M$, so $\pi$ is surjective.

Let $\mathbf{q}\in M$ be arbitrary. Since $\pi$ is a local diffeomorphism, each point of $\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{q})$ has a neighbourhood on which $\pi$ is injective, so $\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{q})$ is a discrete subset of $E$. Since $\pi$ is proper, $\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{q})$ is also compact, so it is finite. Write $\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{q}) = \Set{p_i}_{i=1}^k$. For each $i$, there exists a neighbourhood $V_i$ of $\mathbf{p}_i$ on which $\pi$ is a diffeomorphism onto an open subset $U_i\subseteq M$. Shrinking each $V_i$ if necessary, we may assume also that $V_i \cap V_j = \emptyset$ for $i\neq j$.

Set $U = \bigcap_{i=1}^k U_i$, which is a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{q}$. Then $U$ satisfies $U \subseteq U_i$ for each $i$. Because $K = E\setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^k V_k$ is closed in $E$ adn $\pi$ is a closed map, $\pi(K)$ is closed in $M$. Replacing $U$ by $U\setminus \pi(K)$, we can assume that $U$ also satisfies $pi^{-1}(U) \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^k V_i$.

Finally, after replacing $U$ by the connected component of $U$ containing $\mathbf{q}$, we can assume that $U$ is connected and still satisfies the two partial order conditions. It remains to show that $U$ is evenly covered.

Let $\tilde{V}_i = \pi^{-1}(U) \cap V_i$. By the second condition, $\pi^{-1}(U) = \bigcup_{i=1}^k \tilde{V}_i$. Because $\pi:V_i \to U_i$ is a diffeomorphism, the first condition implies that $\pi:\tilde{V}_i \to U$ is still a diffeomorphism, and in particular $\tilde{V}_i$ is connected. Because $\tilde{V}_i$ are disjoint connected open subsets of $\pi^{-1}(U)$, they are exactly the components of $\pi^{-1}(U)$.

# Smooth submanifolds

## Embedded submanifold

<MathBox title='Embedded submanifold' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary. An *embedded submanifold* of $M$ is a subset $S\subseteq M$ that is a manifold (without boundary) in the subspace topology, endowed with a smooth structure with respect to which the inclusion map $S\hookrightarrow M$ is a smooth embedding. Embedded submanifolds are also known as *regular submanifolds*. An embedded submanifold $S$ is called *properly embedded* if the inclusion $S\hookrightarrow M$ is a proper map.

If $S$ is an embedded submanifold of $M$, the difference $\dim(M) - \dim(S)$ is called the *codimension* of $S$ in $M$, and the containing manifold $M$ is called the *ambient manifold* for $S$. An *embedded hypersurface* is an embedded submanifold of codimension $1$.

<MathBox title='Open submanifolds have codimension zero' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold. The embedded submanifolds of codimension $0$ in $M$ are exactly the open submanifolds.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $S\subseteq M$ is an open submanifold, and let $\iota:S\hookrightarrow M$ be the inclusion map. Becuase $S$ is an open submanifold, it follows that it is a smooth manifold with same dimension as $M$ and there has codimension $0$. 

Any point $\mathbf{p}\in S$ is contained in the domain of some chart $(V,\varphi)$ for $M$. If $\mathbf{p}\in U\subseteq S$, then $(W, \varphi|_W)$ with $W = U \cap V$ is a smooth chart for $S$. In terms of these charts, $\iota$ is represented in coordinates by an identity map, making it a smooth immersion. Since $S$ has the subspace topology, $\iota$ is a smooth embedding. Thus $S$ is an embedded submanifold.

Conversely, suppose that $S$ is any codimension-$0$ embedded submanifold of $M$. Then the inclusion $\iota:S\hookrightarrow M$ is a smooth embedding by definition, and therefore it is a local diffeomorphism, which in turn makes it an open map. Thus $S$ is an open subset of $M$.

<MathBox title='Images of embeddings as submanifolds' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, $N$ is a smooth manifold, and $F:N\to M$ is a smooth embedding. Let $S = F(N)$. With the subspace topology, $S$ is a topological manifold, and it has a unique smooth structure making it into an embedded submanifold of $M$ with the property that $F$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If we give $S$ the subspace topology that it inherits from $M$, then the assumption that $F$ is an embedding means that $F$ can be considered as a homeomorphism from $N$ onto $S$, and thus $S$ is a topological manifold. We give $S$ a smooth structure by taking the smooth charts to be those of the form $(F(U), \varphi\circ F^{-1})$, where $(U,\varphi)$ is any smooth chart for $N$; smooth compatibility of these charts follows immediately from the smooth compatibility of the corresponding charts for $N$. With this smooth structure on $S$, the map $F$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image (essentially
by definition), and this is obviously the only smooth structure with this property. The inclusion map $S\hookrightarrow M$ is equal to the composition of a diffeomorphism followed by a smooth embedding

$$
  S \xrightarrow{F^{-1}} N \xrightarrow{F} M
$$

and therefore it is a smooth embedding.

<MathBox title='Graphs as submanifolds' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth $m$-manifold (without boundary), $N$ is a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary, $U\subseteq M$ is open, and $f: U\to N$ is a smooth map. Let $\Gamma(f) \subseteq M\times N$ denote the graph of $f$

$$
  \Gamma(f) = \Set{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\in M\times N | \mathbf{x}\in U, \mathbf{y}\in f(\mathbf{x})}
$$

Then $\Gamma(f)$ is an embedded $m$-dimensional submanifold of $M\times N$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Define a map $\gamma_f:U\to M\times N$ by $\gamma_f(\mathbf{x}) = (\mathbf{x},f(\mathbf{x}))$. It is a smooth map whose image is $\Gamma(f)$. Because the projection $\pi_M: M\times N\to M$ satisfies $\pi_M \circ \gamma_f (\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}$, the composition $\mathrm{d}(\pi_M)_{(\mathbf{x},f(\mathbf{x}))} \circ \mathrm{d}(\gamma_f)_\mathbf{x}$ is the identity on $T_\mathbf{x} M$ for each $\mathbf{x}\in U$. Thus $\mathrm{d}(\gamma_f)_\mathbf{x}$ is injective, so $\gamma_f$ is a smooth immersion. It is a homeomorphism onto its image because $\pi_M|_{\Gamma(f)}$ is a continuous inverse for it. Hence, $\Gamma(f)$ is an embedded submanifold diffeomorphic to $U$.

With the smooth immersion $\gamma_f:U\subseteq M\to M\times N$ given by $\gamma_f(\mathbf{x}) = (\mathbf{x},f\mathbf{x})$, the graph $\Gamma(f) \subseteq M\times N$ is properly embedded in $M\times N$.

In this case, the projection $\pi_M :M\times N$ is a smooth left inverse for the embedding $\gamma_f :M\to M\times N$. Thus, $\gamma_f$ satisfies the conditions for properness.

### Slice charts for embedded submanifolds

<MathBox title='Slice' boxType='definition'>
If $U\subseteq\R^n$ is open and $k\in\Set{0,\dots,n}$, a $k$-dimensional *slice* of $U$, or simply a $k$-slice, is any subset of the form

$$
  S = \Set{(x^1,\dots,x^k,x^{k+1},\dots,x^n)\in U | x^{k+1} = c^{k+1}\dots,x^n = c^n}
$$

for some constants $c^{k+1},\dots,c^n$.

Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold, and let $(V,\varphi)$ be a smooth chart on $M$. If $S$ is a subset of $V$ such that $\varphi(S)$ is a $k$-slice of $\varphi(V)$, then $S$ is a $k$-slice of $V$.

A subset $S\subseteq M$ is said to satisfy the local $k$-slice conditions if each point of $S$ is contained in the domain of a smooth chart $(V,\varphi)$ for $M$ such that $S\cap V$ is a single $k$-slice in $U$. Any such chart is called a *slice chart* for $S$ in $M$, and the corresponding coordinates are called *slice coordinates*.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Local slice criterion for embedded submanifolds' boxType='theorem'>
Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold. If $S\subseteq M$ is an embedded $k$-dimensional submanifold, then $S$ satisfies the local $k$-slice condtion. Conversely, if $S\substeq M$ is a subset that satisfies the local $k$-slice condition, then with the subspace topology, $S$ is topological $k$-manifold, and it has a smooth structure making it into a $k$-dimensional embedded submanifold of $M$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

First, suppose that $S\subseteq M$ is an embedded $k$-dimensional submanifold. Since the inclusion map $S\hookrightarrow M$ is an immersion, the rank theorem shows that for any $\mathbf{p}\in S$ there are smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ for $S$ and $(V,\psi)$ for $M$, both centered at $\mathbf{p}$, in which the inclusion map $\iota|_U :U\to V$ has the coordinate representation

$$
  (x^1,\dots,x^k)\mapsto (x^1,\dots,x^k,0,\dots,0)
$$

Choose $\varepsilon > 0$ small enough that both $U$ and $V$ contain coordinate balls of redius $\varepsilon$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$, and denote these coordinate balls by $U_0 \subseteq U$ and $V_0 \subseteq V$. It follows that $U_0 = \iota|_U(U_0)$ is exactly a single slice in $V_0$. Because $S$ has the subspace topology, the fact that $U_0$ is open in $S$ means that there is an open subset $W\subseteq M$ such that $U_0 = W \cap S$. Setting $V_1 = V_0 \cap W$, we obtain a smooth chart $(V_1, \psi|_{V_1})$ for $M$ containing $\mathbf{p}$ such that $V_1 \cap S = U_0$, which is a single slice of $V_1$.

Conversely, suppose that $S$ satisfies the local $k$-slice condition. With the subspace topology, $S$ is Hausdorff and second-countable, because both properties are inherited by subspaces. To see that $S$ is locally Euclidean, we construct an atlas. The basic idea of the construction is that if $(x^1,\dots,x^n)$ are slice coordinates for $S$ in $M$, we can use $(x^1,\dots,x^k)$ as local coordinates for $S$.

Let $\pi:\R^n \to\R^k$ denote the projection onto the first $k$ coordinates. Let $(U,\varphi)$ be any slice chart for $S$ in $M$ and define

$$
\begin{align*}
  V =& U \cap S \\
  \hat{V} =& \pi\circ\varphi(V) \\
  \psi =& \pi\circ\varphi|_V: V\to\hat{V}
\end{align*}
$$

By definition of slice charts, $\varphi(V)$ is the intersection of $\varphi(U)$ with a certain $k$-slice $A\subseteq\R^n$ defined by setting $x^{k+1} = c^{k+1},\dots,x^n = c^n$, and therefore $\varphi(V)$ is open in $A$. Since $\pi|_A$ is a diffeomorphism from $A$ to $\R^n$, it follows that $\hat{V}$ is open in $\R^k$. Moreover, $\psi$ is a homeomorphism because it has a continuous inverse given by $\varphi^{-1}\circ j|_{\hat{V}}$ where $j:\R^k \to\R^n$ is the map

$$
  j(x^1,\dots,x^k) = (x^k,\dots,x^k,c^{k+1},\dots,c^n)
$$

Thus, $S$ is a topological $k$-manifold, and the inclusion map $\iota:S\hookrightarrow M$ is a topological embedding.

To put a smooth structure on $S$, we need to verify that the charts constructed above are smoothly compatible. Suppose that $(U,\varphi)$ and $(U',\varphi')$ are two slice charts for $S$ in $M$, and let $(V,\psi)$ and $(V',\psi')$ be the corresponding charts for $S$. The transition map is given by $\psi'\circ\psi = \pi\circ\varphi'\circ\varphi^{-1} \circ j$, which is a composition of four smooth maps. Thus, the atlas we have constructed is in fact a smooth atlas, and it defines a smooth structure on $S$. In terms of a slice chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ and the corresponding chart $(V,\varphi)$ for $S$, the inclusion map $S\hookrightarrow M$ has a coordinate representation of the form

$$
  (x^1,\dots,x^k)\mapsto(x^1,\dots,x^k,c^{k+1},\dots,c^n)
$$

which is a smooth immersion. Since the inclusion is a smooth immersion and a topological embedding, $S$ is an embedded submanifold.

<MathBox title='Local slice criterion for embedded submanifolds' boxType='theorem'>

### Level sets

<MathBox title='Local slice criterion for embedded submanifolds' boxType='theorem'>
If $\Phi: M\to N$ is any map and $\mathbf{c}$ is any point of $N$, the preimage $\Phi^{-1}(\mathbf{c})$ is a *level set* of $\phi$. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Constant-rank level set theorem' boxType='theorem'>
Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds, and let $\Phi: M\to N$ be a smooth map with constant rank $r$. Each level set of $\Phi$ is a properly embedded submanifold of codimension $r$ in $M$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $m = \dim(M)$, $n = \dim(N)$ and $k = m - r$. Let $\mathbf{c}\in N$ be arbitrary, and let $S$ denote the level set $\varphi^{-1}(\mathbf{c})\subseteq M$. From the rank theorem, for each $\mathbf{p}\in S$ there are smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$ and $(V,\psi)$ centered at $\mathbf{c} = \Phi(\mathbf{p})$ in which $\Phi$ has a coordinate representation of

$$
  \Phi(x^1,\dots,x^r,x^{r+1},\dots,x^m) = (x^1,\dots,x^r,0,\dots,0)
$$
 
and therefore $S\cap U$ is the slice

$$
  \Set{(x^1,\dots,x^r,x^{r+1},\dots,x^m)\in U | x^1 =\cdots = x^r = 0}
$$

Thus, $S$ satisfies the local $k$-slice condition, so it is an embedded submanifold of dimension $k$. It is closed in $M$ by continuity, so it is properly embedded.

<MathBox title='Submersion level set theorem' boxType='corollary'>
If $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds and $\Phi: M\to N$ is a smooth submersion, then each level set of $\Phi$ is a properly embedded submanifold whose codimension is equal to the dimension of $N$.

<MathBox title='Regular and critical values' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds and $\Phi: M\to N$ is a smooth map, a point $\mathbf{p}\in M$ is said to be a *regular point* of $\Phi$ if $\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p} M \to T_{\Phi(\mathbf{p})}N$ is surjective; it is a *critical point* of $\Phi$ otherwise. In particular, every point of $M$ is critical if $\dim(M) < \dim(N)$, and every point is regular if and only if $F$ is a submersion.

A point $\mathbf{c}\in N$ is a *regular value* of $\Phi$ is every point of the level set $\Phi^{-1}(\mathbf{c})$ is a regular point, and a *critical value* otherwise. In particular, if $\Phi^{-1}(\mathbf{c}) = \emptyset$ then $\mathbf{c}$ is a regular value.

A level set $\Phi^{-1}(\mathbf{c})$ is called a *regular value set* if $\mathbf{c}$ is a regular value of $\Phi$. In other words, a regular level set is a level set consisting entirely of regular points of $\Phi$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Critical point and regular value' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $f:M\to N$ is a smooth map. A point $p\in M$ is called a critical point of $f$ if the differential of $f$ at $p$, denoted $\mathrm{d}f_p$, is not surjective. Equivalently, the Jacobian of the map $\psi\circ f\phi^{-1}: \R^n \to\R^M$ has not maximal rank, i.e.

$$
  \mathrm{rank}f_p := \mathrm{rank}\left( J_{\psi\circ f\phi^{-1}} [h(p)] \right) < n
$$

A point $q\in N$ is called a regular value $f$ if $f^{-1}[\Set{q}]\in M$ does not contain critical points.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Regular value theorem' boxType='theorem'>
Let $M, N$ be smooth manifolds of dimension $m$ and $n$ with $m\geq n$. Suppose that $f:M\to N$ is a smooth map, and $q\in N$ be a regular value of $f$. Then $f^{-1}[\Set{q}]$ is a $(m-n)$-dimensional submanifold of $M$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Regular level set theorem' boxType='corollary'>
Every regular level set of a smooth map between smooth manifolds is a properly embedded submanifold whose codimension is equal to the dimension of the codomain.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\Phi:M\to N$ be a smooth map and let $\mathbf{c}\in N$ be a regular value. The set $U$ of points $\mathbf{p}\in M$ where $\mathrm{rank}(\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathbf{p}) = \dim(N)$ is open in $M$ and contains $\Phi^{-1}(\mathbf{c})$ because of the assumption that $\mathbf{c}$ is a regular value. It follows that $\Phi|_U:U\to N$ is a smooth submersion, and the submersion level set theorem shows that $\Phi^{-1}(\mathbf{c})$ is an embedded submanifold of $U$. Since the composition of smooth embeddings $\Phi^{-1}(\mathbf{c}) \hookrightarrow U \hookrightarrow M$ is again a smooth embedding, it follows that $\Phi^{-1}(\mathbf{c})$ is en embedded submanifold of $M$, and it is closed by continuity.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $S$ be a subset of a smooth $m$-manifold $M$. Then $S$ is an embedded $k$-submanifold if and only if every point of $S$ has a neighbourhood $U\subseteq M$ such that $U\cap S$ is a level set of a smooth submersion $\Phi:U\to\R^{m-k}$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

First, suppose that $S$ is an embedded $k$-submanifold. If $(x^1,\dots,x^m)$ are slice coordinates for $S$ on an open subset $U\subseteq M$, the map $\Phi:U\to\R^{m-k}$ given in coordinates by $\Phi(\mathbf{x}) = (x^{k+1},\dots,x^m)$ is easily seen to be a smooth submersion, one of whose level sets is $S\cap U$.

Conversely, suppose that around every point $\mathbf{p}\in S$ there is a neighbourhood $U$ and a smooth submersion $\Phi:U\to\R^{m-k}$ such that $S\cap U$ is a level set of $\Phi$. By the submersion level set theorem, $S\cap U$ is an embedded submanifold of $U$, so it satisfies the local slice condition. It follows that $S$ is itself an embedded submanifold of $M$.

<MathBox title='Defining map' boxType='definition'>
If $S\subseteq M$ is an embedded submanifold, a smooth map $\Phi: M\to N$ such that $S$ is a regular level set of $\Phi$, is called a *defining map* for $S$. More generally, if $U$ is an open subset of $M$ and $\Phi:U\to N$ is a smooth map such that $S\cap U$ is a regular level set of $\Phi$, then $\Phi$ is called a *local defining map* for $S$.

## Immersed submanifolds

<MathBox title='Immersed submanifold' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. An *immersed submanifold* of $M$ is a subset $S\subseteq M$ endowed with a topology with respect to which it is a topological manifold (without boundary), and a smooth structure with respect to which the inclusion map $S\hookrightarrow M$ is a smooth immersion. If $S$ is an immersed submanifold then $\dim(M) - \dim(S)$ is the *codimension* of $S$ in $M$. Every embedded submanifold is also an immersed submanifold.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Images of immersions as submanifolds' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, $N$ is a smooth manifold, and $F:N\to M$ is an injective smooth immersion. Let $S = F(N)$. Then $S$ has a unique topology and smooth structure such that it is a smooth submanifold of $M$ and such that $F:N\to S$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

We give $S$ a topology by declaring a set $U\subseteq S$ to be open if and only if $F^{-1}(U) \subseteq N$ is open, and then give it a smooth structure by taking the smooth charts to be those of the form $(F(U),\varphi\circ F^{-1})$ where $(U,\varphi)$ is any smooth chart for $N$. The smooth compatibility condition follows from that for $N$. With this topology and smooth structure on $S$, the map $F$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image, and these are the only topology and smooth structure on $S$ with this property. The inclusion  $S\hookrightarrow M$ can be written as the composition

$$
  S \xrightarrow{F^{-1}} N \xrightarrow{F} M
$$

In this case, the first map is a diffeomorphism and the second is a smooth immerision, so the composition is a smooth immersion.

It is alled a *smooth local parametrization* if it is a diffeomorphism onto its image. If the image of $X$ is all of $S$, it is called a *global parametrization*.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\mathbf{p}\in N$ be arbitrary and let $\mathbf{q} = F(\mathbf{p})\in S$. Since immersed submanifolds are locally embedded, there is a neighbourhood $V$ of $\mathbf{q}$ in $S$ such that $\iota|_V: V\hookrightarrow M$ is a smooth embedding. Thus, there exists a smooth chart $(W,\psi)$ for $M$ that is a slice chart for $V$ in $M$ centered at $\mathbf{q}$. The fact that $(W,\psi)$ is a slice chart means that $(V_0, \tilde{\psi})$ is a smooth chart for $V$, where $V_0 = W \cap V$ and $\tilde{\psi} = \pi \circ\psi$ with $\pi:\R^n \to\R^k$ being the projection onto the first $k = \dim(S)$ coordinates. Since $V_0 = (\iota|_V)^{-1}(W)$ is open in $V$, it is open in $S$ in its given topology, and so $(V_0, \tilde{\psi})$ is also a smooth chart for $S$.

Let $U = F^{-1}(V_0)$, which is an open subset of $N$ containing $\mathbf{p}$. Choose a smooth chart $(U_0,\varphi)$ for $N$ such that $\mathbf{p}\in U_0 \subseteq U$. Then the coordinate representation of $F:N\to S$ with respect to the charts $(U_0, \varphi)$ and $(V_0,\tilde{\psi})$ is

$$
  \tilde{\psi}\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1} = \pi \circ(\psi\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1})

which is smooth because $F:N\to M$ is smooth.

### Uniqueness of smooth structures on submanifolds

<MathBox title='' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold. If $S\subseteq M$ is an embedded submanifold, it has a unique subspace topology and smooth structure (as described in the local slice condition theorem). 

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $S\subseteq M$ is an embedded $k$-submanifold. It then satisfies the local $k$-slice condition, so it is an embedded submanifold with the subspace topology. Suppose that were some other topology and smooth structure on $S$, making it into an immersed submanifold of some dimension. Let $\tilde{S}$ denote the same set $S$, considered as a smooth manifold with non-standard topology and smooth structure, and let $\tilde{\iota}:\tilde{S}\hookrightarrow M$ denote the inclusion map, which by assumption is an injective immesion (but not necessarily an embedding). Because $\tilde{\iota}(\tilde{S}) = S$, the embedded codomain restriction of smooth maps implies that $\tilde{\iota}$ is also smooth when considered as a map from $\tilde{S}$ to $S$. For each $\mathbf{p}\in\tilde{S}$, the differential $\mathrm{d}\tilde{\iota}_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p}\tilde{S} \to T_\mathbf{p}M$ is equal to the composition

$$
  T_\mathbf{p}\tilde{S} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{d}\tilde{\iota}_\mathbf{p}} T_\mathbf{p}S \xrightarrow{\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}} T_\mathbf{p}M
$$

where $\iota: S\hookrightarrow M$ is also an inclusion. Because this composition is injective, $\mathrm{d}\tilde{\iota}_\mathbf{p}$ must be injective. In particular, this means that $\tilde{\iota}:\tilde{S}\to S$ is an immersion. Because it is bijective, it follows from the global rank theorem that it is a diffeomorphism. In other words, the topology and smooth manifold structure of $\tilde{S}$ are the same as those of $S$.

### The tangent space to a submanifold

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and let $S\subseteq M$ be an immersion or embedded submanifold. Since the inclusion map $\iota:S\hookrightarrow M$ is a smooth immersion, at each point $\mathbf{p}\in S$ we have an injective linear map $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}:T_\mathbf{p}S \to T_\mathbf{p}M$. In terms of derivations, this injection works in the following way: for any vector $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p} S$, the image vector $\tilde{\mathbf{v}} = \mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}) \in T_\mathbf{p}M$ acts on smooth functions on $M$ by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{\mathbf{v}} f = \mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v})f = \mathbf{v}(f\circ\iota) = \mathbf{v}(f|_S)
\end{align*}
$$

Identifying $T_\mathbf{p}M$ with its image under this map, the tangent space $T_\mathbf{p}M$ can be thought of as a certain linear subspace of $T_\mathbf{p}M$. This identification makes sense regardless of whether $S$ is embedded or immersed.

<MathBox title='' boxType='propositon'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, $S\subseteq M$ is an immersed or embedded submanifold, and $\mathbf{p}\in S$.

Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold, $S\subseteq M$ is an embedded submanifold, and $\mathbf{p}\in S$. As a subspace of $T_\mathbf{p}M$, the tangent space $T_\mathbf{p}S$ is characterized by

$$
  T_\mathbf{p}S = \Set{\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p}M | \mathbf{v}f = 0, f\in C^\infty (M) \land f|_S = 0}
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

First, suppose that $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p}M \subseteq T_\mathbf{p} M$. This means, that $\mathbf{v} = \mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{w})$ for some $\mathbf{w}\in T_\mathbf{p} S$, where $\iota:S\to M$ is an inclusion. If $f$ is an y smooth real-valued function on $M$ that vanishes on $S$, then $f\circ\iota \equiv 0$ so

$$
  \mathbf{v}f = \mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{w})f = \mathbf{w}(f\circ\iota) = 0
$$

Conversely, if $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p}M$ satisfies $\mathbf{v}f = 0$ whenever $f$ vanishes on $S$, we need to show that there is a vector $\mathbf{w}\in T_\mathbf{p}S$ such taht $\mathbf{v} = \mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{w})$. Let $(x^1,\dots,x^n)$ be slice coordinates for $S$ in some neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{p}$, so that $U\cap S$ is the subset of $U$ where $x^{k+1} = \cdots = x^n = 0$ and $(x^1,\dots,x^k)$ are coordinates for $U\cap S$. Because the inclusion map $\iota:S\cap U\hookrightarrow M$ has the coordinate representation

$$
  \iota(x^1,\dots,x^k) = (x^1,\dots,x^k,0,\dots,0)
$$

in these coordinates, it follows that $T_\mathbf{p}S$, i.e. $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}(T_\mathbf{p} S)$, is exactly the subspace of $T_\mathbf{p}M$ spanned by $\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p}$. If we write the coordinate representation of $\mathbf{v}$ as

$$
  \mathbf{v} = \sum_{i=1}^n v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p}
$$

we see that $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p} S$ if and only if $v^i = 0$ for $i > k$.

Let $\varphi$ be a smooth bump function supported in $U$ that is equal to $1$ in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$. Choose an index $j > k$, and consider the function $f(x) = \varphi(\mathbf{x})x^j$, extended to be zero on $M\setminus\mathrm{supp}(\varphi)$. Then $f$ vanishes identically on $S$, so

$$
  0 = \mathbf{v}f = \sum_{i=1}^n v^i \frac{\partial (\varphi(\mathbf{x}x^j))}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p}) = v^i \delta_i^j = v^j
$$

Thus, $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p} S$ as desired.

Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold and that $S\subseteq M$ is an embedded submanifold. If $\Phi:U\to N$ is any local defining map for $S$, then $T_\mathbf{p}S = \mathrm{ker}(\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathbf{p}): T_\mathbf{p}M \to T_{\Phi(\mathbf{p})}N$ for each $\mathbf{p}\in S\cap U$.

<details>

Recall that we identify $T_\mathbf{p}S$ with the subspace $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}(T_\mathbf{p}S) \subseteq T_\mathbf{p}M$, where $\iota:S\hookrightarrow M$ is the inclusion map. Because $\Phi\circ\iota$ is constant on $S\cap U$, it follows that $\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathbf{p}\circ\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}$ is the zero map from $T_\mathbf{p}S$ to $T_{\Phi(\mathbf{p})}N$, and therefore $\mathrm{ran}(\mathbf{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}) \subseteq \mathrm{ker}(\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathbf{p})$. On the other hand, $\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathbf{p}$ is surjective by the definition of a defining map, so the rank-nullity theorem implies that

$$
\begin{align*}
  \dim(\mathrm{ker}(\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathbf{p})) =& \dim(T_\mathbf{p}M) - \dim(T_{\Phi(\mathbf{p})}N) \\
  =& \dim(T_\mathbf{p}S) = \dim(\mathrm{ran}(\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}))
\end{align*}

which implies that $\mathrm{ran}(\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}) = \mathrm{ker}(\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathbf{p})$.

</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Every smooth manifold with boundary admits a boundary defining function.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\Set{(U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha)}$ be a collection of smooth charts whose domains cover an $n$-manifold $M$. For each $\alpha$, defined a smooth function $f_\alpha: U_\alpha \to[0,\infty)$ as follows: if $U_\alpha$ is an interior chart, let $f_\alpha \equiv 1$, while if $U_\alpha$ is a boundary chart, let $f_\alpha(x^1,\dots,x^n) = x^n$. Thus, $f_\alpha(\mathbf{p})$ is positive if $\mathbf{p}\in\mathrm{int}(M)$ and zero if $\mathbf{p}\in\partial M$. 

Let $\Set{\psi_\alpha}$ be a partition of unity subordinate to this cover, and let $f = \sum_\alpha \psi_\alpha f_\alpha$. Then $f$ is smooth, identically zero on $\partial M$, and strictly positive in $\mathrm{int}(M)$. To see that $\mathrm{d}f$ does not vanish on $\partial M$, suppose that $\mathbf{p}\in\partial M$ and that $\mathrm{v}$ is an inward-pointing vector at $\mathbf{p}$. For each $\alpha$ such that $\mathbf{p}\in U_\alpha$, we have $f_\alpha(\mathbf{p})$ = 0 and $\mathrm{d}f_\alpha|_\mathbf{p} = \mathrm{d}x^n|_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}) > 0$ by properties of inward-pointing vectors. Thus

$$
  \mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}) = \sum_\alpha (f_\alpha (\mathbf{p})\mathrm{d}\psi_\alpha|_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}) + \psi_\alpha(\mathbf{p})\mathrm{d}f_\alpha|_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}))
$$

For each $\alpha$, the first term in parenthesis is zero and the second is nonnegative, and there is at least one $\alpha$ for which the second term is positive. Thus $\mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}) > 0$, which implies that $\mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p}\neq 0$.

## Submanifolds with boundary

<MathBox title='Smooth submanifold with boundary' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, a *smooth submanifold with boundary* in $M$ is a subset $S\subseteq M$ endowed with a topology and smooth structure making it into a smooth manifold with boundary such that the inclusion map is a smooth immersion. If the inclusion map is an embedding, then it is called an *embedded submanifold with boundary*. In the general case, it is an *immersed submanifold with boundary*. A *regular domain* in $M$ is a properly embedded codimension-$0$ submanifold with boundary.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold without boundary and $D\subseteq M$ is a regular domain. The topological interior and boundary of $D$ are equal to its manifold interior and boundary, respectively.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $\mathbf{p}\in D$ is arbitrary. If $\mathbf{p}$ is in the manifold boundary of $D$, then the local immersion theorem shows that there exists a smooth boundary chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $D$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$ and a smooth chart $(V,\psi)$ for $M$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$ in which any smooth immersion $F:M\to D$ has the coordinate representation $F(x^1,\dots,x^n) = (x^1,\dots,x^n)$, where $n = \dim(M) = \dim(D)$. Since $D$ has the subspace topology, $U = D\cap W$ for some open subset $W\subseteq M$, so $V_0  = V \cap W$ is a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ in $M$ such that $V_0 \cap D$ consists of all the points in $V_0$ whose $x^m$ coordinate is nonnegative. Thus every neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ intersects both $D$ and $M\setminus D$, so $\mathbf{p}$ is in the topological boundary of $D$.

On the other hand, suppose that $\mathbf{p}$ is in the manifold interior of $D$. The manifold interior is a smooth embedded codimension-$0$ submanifold without boundary in $M$, so it is an open subset. Thus, $\mathbf{p}$ is in the topological interior of $D$.

Conversely, if $\mathbf{p}$ is in the topological interior of $D$, then it is not in the topological boundary, so the preceding argument shows that it is not in the manifold boundary and hence must be in the manifold interior. Similarly, if $\mathbf{p}$ is in the topological boundary, it is also in the manifold boundary.

<MathBox title='Half-slice' boxType='definition'>

$$
  \Set{(x^1,\dots,x^n)\in U | x^{k+1} = c^{k+1},\dots, x^n = c^n, x^k \geq 0}
$$

A subset $S\subseteq M$ satisfies the local $k$-slice condition for submanifolds with boundary if each point of $S$ is contained in the domain of a smooth chart $(U, (x^i))$ such that $S\cap U$ is either an ordinary $k$-dimensional slice or a $k$-dimensional half-slice. In the former case, the chart is called an *interior slice chart* for $S$ in $M$, and in the latter, it is a *boundary slice chart* for $S$ in $M$.

<MathBox title='' boxType='theorem'>

# Lie groups

<MathBox title='Lie group' boxType='definition'>
A *Lie group* is a smooth manifold $G$ (without boundary) that is also a group in the algebraic sense, with the property that the multiplication map $G\times G\to G$ given by $m(g,h) = gh$, and inversion map $i:G\to G$ given by $i(g) = g^{-1}$, are both smooth. A Lie group is, in particular, a *topological group*, a topological space with a group structure such that the multiplication and inversion maps are continuous.
</MathBox>

If $G$ is a Lie group, any element $g\in G$ defines maps $L_g,R_g: G\to G$, called *left translation* and *right translation*, respectively, given by

$$
\begin{align*}
  L_g(h) =& gh \\
  R_g(h) =& hg
\end{align*}
$$

Because $L_g$ can be expressed as the composition of smooth maps $G\xrightarrow{\iota_g} G\times G \xrightarrow{m} G$, where $\iota_g(h) = (g,h)$ and $m$ is multiplication, it follows that $L_g$ is smooth. It is actually a diffeomorphism of $G$, because $L_{g^{-1}}$ is a smooth inverse for it. Similarly $R_g$ is a diffeomorphism.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
If $G$ is a smooth manifold with a group structure such that the map $G\times G\to G$ given by $(g,h) \mapsto gh^{-1}$ is smooth, then $G$ is a Lie group.

## Lie group homomorphism

<MathBox title='Lie group homomorphism' boxType='proposition'>
If $G$ and $H$ are Lie groups, a *Lie group homomorphism* from $G$ to $H$ is a smooth map $F:G\to H$ that is also a group homomorphism. It is called a *Lie group isomorphism* if it is also a diffeomorphism, which implies that is has an inverse that is also a Lie group homomorphism. In this case, $G$ and $H$ are *isomorphic Lie groups*.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='theorem'>
Every Lie group homomorphism has constant rank.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $F:G\to H$ be a Lie group homomorphism, and let $e$ and $\tilde{e}$ denote the idenity elements of $G$ and $H$, respectively. Suppose that $g_0$ is an arbitrary element of $G$. We will show that $\mathrm{d}F_{g_0}$ has the same rank as $\mathrm{d}F_e$. The fact that $F$ is a homomorphism means that for all $g\in G$

$$
\begin{align*}
  F(L_{g_0}(g)) =& F(g_0 g) = F(g_0)F(g) \\
  L_{F(g_0)}(F(g))
\end{align*}
$$

or in other words, $F\circ L_{g_0} = L_{F(g_0)} \circ F$. Taking differentials of both sides at the identiy using the composition property of differentials gives

$$
  \mathrm{d}F_{g_0} \circ \mathrm{d}\left(L_{g_0}\right)_e = \mathrm{d}\left( L_{F(g_0)} \right)_{\tilde{e}} \circ \mathrm{d}F_e
$$

Left multiplication by any element of a Lie group is a diffeomorphism, so both $\mathrm{d}\left(L_{g_0}\right)_e$ and $\mathrm{d}\left(L_{F(g_0)} \right)_{\tilde{e}}$ are isomorphisms. Because composing with an isomorphism does not change the rank of a linear map, it follows that $\mathrm{d}F_{g_0}$ and $\mathrm{d}F_e$ have the same rank.

### Universal covering group

<MathBox title='Existence of a universal covering group' boxType='theorem'>
Let $G$ be a connected Lie group. There exists a simply connected Lie group $\tilde{G}$, called the *universal covering group* of $G$ that admits a smooth covering map $\pi:\tilde{G}\to G$ that is also a Lie group homomorphism.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\tilde{G}$ be the universal covering manifold of $G$ and $\pi:\tilde{G}\to G$ be the corresponding smooth covering map. Then $\pi\times\pi: \tilde{G}\times\tilde{G}\to G\times G$ is also a smooth covering map.

Let $m:G\times G\to G$ and $i:G\to G$ denote the multiplication and inversion maps, respectively, and let $\tilde{e}$ be an arbitrary element of the fibre $\pi^{-1}(e) \subseteq \tilde{G}$. Since $\tilde{G}$ is simply connected, the lifting criterion for covering maps guarantees that the map $m\circ (\pi\times\pi): \tilde{G}\times\tilde{G} \to G$ has a unique continuous lift $\tilde{m}:\tilde{G}\times\tilde{G}\to\tilde{G}$ satisfying $\tilde{m}(\tilde{e},\tilde{e}) = \tilde{e}$ and $\pi\circ\tilde{m}= m\circ(\pi\times\pi)$

$$
\begin{CD}
  \tilde{G}\times\tilde{G} @>{\tilde{m}}>> \tilde{G} \\
  @V{\pi\times\pi}VV @VV{\pi}V \\
  G\times G @>>{m}> G
\end{CD}
$$

Because $\pi$ is a local diffeomorphism and $\pi\circ\tilde{m} = m\circ(\pi\times\pi)$ is smooth, it follows that $\tilde{m}$ is smooth. By the same reasoning, $i\circ\pi:\tilde{G}\to G$ has a smooth lift $\tilde{i}:\tilde{G}\to\tilde{G}$ satisfying $\tilde{i}(\tilde{e}) = \tilde{e}$ and $\pi\circ\tilde{i} = i\circ\pi$

$$
\begin{CD}
  \tilde{G} @>{\tilde{i}}>> \tilde{G} \\
  @V{\pi}VV @VV{\pi}V \\
  G @>>{i}> G
\end{CD}
$$

We define multiplication and inversion in $\tilde{G}$ by $xy = \tilde{m}(x,y)$ and $x^{-1} = \tilde{i}(x)$ for all $x,y\in\tilde{G}$. Then the commutative diagrams can be rewritten as $\pi(xy) = \pi(x)\pi(y)$ and $\pi(x^{-1}) = \pi(x)^{-1}$.

It remains only to show that $\tilde{G}$ is a group with these operations for then it is a Lie group because $\tilde{m}$ and $\tilde{i}$ are smooth, and the first commutative diagram shows that $\pi$ is a homeomorphism.

First, we show that $\tilde{e}$ is an identity for multiplication in $\tilde{G}$. Consider the map $f:\tilde{G}\to\tilde{G}$ defined by $f(x) = \tilde{e}x$. Then the first commutative diagram implies that $\pi\circ f(x) = \pi(\tilde{e})\pi(x) = e\pi(x) = \pi(x)$, so $f$ is a lift of $\pi:\tilde{G}\to G$. The identity map $\mathrm{id}_{\tilde{G}}$ is another lift of $\pi$, and it agrees with $f$ at a point because $f(\tilde{e}) = \tilde{m}(\tilde{e},\tilde{e}) = \tilde{e}$, so the unique lifting property of covering maps implies that $f = \mathrm{id}_{\tilde{G}}$, or equivalentlym $\tilde{e}x = x$ for all $x\in\tilde{G}$. The same argument shows that $x\tilde{e} = x$.

Next, to show that multiplication in $\tilde{G}$ is associative, consider the two maps $\alpha_L,\aplha_R: \tilde{G}\times\tilde{G}\to\tilde{G}\times\tilde{G}$ defined by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \alpha_L (x,y,z) =& (xy)z \\
  \alpha_R (x,y,z) =& x(yz)
\end{align*}
$$

The the first commutative diagram applied repeatedly implies that

$$
\begin{align*}
  \pi\circ\alpha_L(x,y,z) =& (\pi(x)\pi(y))\pi(z) \\
  =& \pi(x)(\pi(y)\pi(z)) \\
  =& \pi\circ\alpha_R (x,y,z)
\end{align*}
$$

so $\alpha_L$ and $\alpha_R$ are both lifts of the same map $\alpha(x,y,z) = \pi(x)\pi(y)\pi(z)$. Because $\alpha_L$ and $\alpha_R$ agree at $(\tilde{e},\tilde{e},\tilde{e})$, they are equal. A similar argument showst that $x^{-1} x = xx^{-1} = \tilde{e}$, so $\tilde{G}$ is a group.

<MathBox title='Uniqueness of the universal covering group' boxType='theorem'>
For any connected Lie group $G$, the universal convering group is unique in the following sense: if $\tilde{G}$ and $\tilde{G}'$ are simply connected Lie groups that admit smooth covering maps $\pi:\tilde{G}\to G$ and $\pi': \tilde{G}\to G$ that are also Lie group homomorphism, then there exists a Lie group homomorphism $\phi:\tilde{G}\to\tilde{G}'$ such that $\pi'\circ\Phi = \pi$.

Let $G$ be a Lie group, and suppose that $H\subseteq G$ is a subgroup that is also an embedded manifold. Then $H$ is a Lie subgroup.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

We only need to check that multiplication $H\times H\to H$ and inversion $H\to H$ are smooth maps. Because multiplication is a smooth map from $G\times G$ into $G$, its restriction is clearly smooth from $H\times H$ into $G$ (this is true even if $H$ is merely immersed). Because $H$ is a subgroup, multiplication takes $H\times H$ into $H$, and since $H$ is embedded, this is a smooth map into $H$. A similar argument applies to inversion. This proves that $H$ is a Lie subgroup.

<summary>Proof</summary>

If $H$ is open in $G$, it is embedded. In addition, every left coset $gH = \Set{gh | h\in H}$ is open in $G$ because it is the image of the open subset $H$ under the diffeomorphism $L_g$. Because $G\setminus H$ is the union of the cosets of $H$ other than $H$ itself, it is open, and therefore $H$ is closed in $G$. Because $H$ is both open and closed, it is a union of components.

If $G$ is a group and $S\subseteq G$, the subgroup generated by $S$ is the smallest subgroup containing $S$, i.e. the intersection of all subgroups containing $S$.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $G$ is a Lie group, and that $W\subseteq G$ is any neighbourhood of the identity.
1. $W$ generates an open subgroup of $G$
2. If $W$ is connected, it generates a connected open subgroup of $G$
3. If $G$ is connected, then $W$ generates $G$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Let $W\subseteq G$ by any neighbourhood of the identity, and let $H$ be the subgroup generated by $W$. As a matter of notation, if $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $G$, let us write

$$
\begin{align*}
  AB =& \Set{ab | a\in A, b\in B} \\
  A^{-1} =& \Set{a^{-1} | a\in A}
\end{align*}
$$

For each $k\in\N_+$, let $W_k$ denote the set of all elements of $G$ that can be expressed as products of $k$ or fewer elements of $W\cup W^{-1}$. It follows that $H = \bigcup_{k\in\N_+} W_k$. Furthermore, $W^{-1}$ is open because it is the image of $W$ under the inversion map, which is a diffeomorphism. Thus $W_1 = W \cup W^{-1}$ is open, and for each $k > 1$ we have

$$
  W_k = W_1 W_{k-1} = \bigcup_{g\in W_1} L_g (W_{k-1})
$$

Because each $L_g$ is a diffeomorphism, it follows by induction that each $W_k$ is open, and thus $H$ is open.

**(2):** Suppose that $W$ is connected. Then $W^{-1}$ is also connected because it is a diffeomorphic image of $W$, and $W_1 = W \cup W^{-1}$ is connected because it is a union of connected sets with the identity in common. Therefore, $W_2 = m(W_1 \times W_1)$ is connected because it is the image of a connected space under the continuous multiplication map $m$, and it follows by induction that $W_k = m(W_1\times W_{k-1})$ is connected for each $k$. Thus, $H = \bigcup_{k\in\N_+} W_k$ is connected because it is a union of connected subsets with the identity in common.

**(3):**Assume that $G$ is connected. Since $H$ is an open subgroup, it is closed by the previous lemma, and it is not empty because it contains the identity. Thus, $H = G$.

Let $F:G\to H$ be a Lie group homomorphism. The kernel of $F$ is a properly embedded Lie subgroup of $G$, whose codimension is equal to the rank of $F$.

Since a Lie group has constant rank, it follows from the global rank theorem that $F$ is a smooth immersion. Then $F(G)$ has a unique smooth manifold structure such that it is an immersed submanifold of $H$, and $F$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image.

<MathBox title='Embedded Lie subgroups are properly embedded submanifolds' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $G$ is a Lie group and that $H\subseteq G$ is a Lie subgroup. Then $H$ is closed in $G$ if and only if it is embedded.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Assume first that $H$ is embedded in $G$. To prove that $H$ is closed, let $g$ be an arbitrary point of $\overline{H}$. Then there is a sequence $(h_i)_{i\in\N}$ of points in $H$ converging to $g$. Let $U$ be the domain of a slice chart for $H$ containing the identity, and let $W$ be a smaller neighbourhood of $e$ such that $\overline{W}\subseteq U$. Then there is a neighbourhood $V$ of $e$ with the property that $g_1 g_2^{-1} \in W$, whenever $g_1, g_2\in V$.

Because $h_i g^{-1} \to e$, by discarding finitely many terms of the sequence we may assume that $h_i g^{-1} \in V$ for all $i$. This implies that

$$
  h_i h_j^{-1} = (h_i g^{-1})(h_j g^{-1})^{-1}\in W,\; \forall i,j \in\N
$$

Fixing $j$ and letting $i\to \infty$, we find that $h_i h_j^{-1} \to gh_j^{-1} \in\overline{W}\subseteq U$. Since $H \cap U$ is a slice, it is closed in $U$, and therefore $gh_j^{-1}\in H$, which implies $g\in H$. Thus $H$ is closed.

Conversely, assume that $H$ is a closed Lie subgroup, and let $m = \dim(H)$ and $n = \dim(G)$. We need to show that $H$ is an embedded submanifold of $G$. If $m = n$, then by the conditions for embeddedness $H$ is embedded, so we may assume that $m < n$.

If suffices to show that for some $h_1\in H$, there is a neighbourhood $U_1$ of $h_1$ in $G$ such that $H \cap U_1$ is an embedded submanifold of $U_1$. If $h$ is any other point of $H$, the right translation $R_{hh_1^{-1}}: G\to G$ is a diffeomorphism of $G$ that takes $H$ to $H$, and takes $U_1$ to a neighbourhood $U'_1$ of $h$ such that $U'_1 \cap H$ is embedded in $U'_1$, so it follows from the local slice criterion that $H$ is an embedded submanifold of $G$.

Because every immersed submanifold is locally embedded, there exists a neighbourhood $V$ of $e$ in $H$ and a slice chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $V$ in $G$ centered at $e$ By shrinking $U$ if necessary, we may assume that it is a coordinate cube, and $U\cap V$ is the set of points whose coordinates are of the form $(x^1,\dots,x^m,0,\dots,0)$. Let $S\subseteq U$ be the set of points with coordinates of the form $(0,\dots,0,x^{m+1},\dots,x^n)$. It is the slice perpendiculaar to $U \cap V$ in these coordinates. Then $S$ is an embedded submanifold of $U$ and hence of $G$. Note that in these coordinates, $T_e V$ is spanned by the first $m$ coordinate vectors and $T_e S$ by the last $n-m$, so $T_e G = T_e V \oplus T_e S$.

Consider the map $\psi:V\times S\to G$ obtained by restricting group multiplication: $\psi(v,s) = vs$. Since $\psi(v,e) = v$ for $v\in V$ and $\psi(e,s) = s$ for $s\in S$, it follows easily that the differential of $\psi$ at $(e,e)$ satisfies $\mathrm{d}\psi(X,0) = X$ and $\mathrm{d}\psi(0,Y) = Y$ for $X\in T_e V$ and $Y\in T_e S$, and therefore $\mathrm{d}\psi_{(e,e)}$ is bijective. By the inverse function theorem, there are connected neighbourhoods $W_0$ of $(e,e)$ in $V\times S$ and $U_0$ of $e$ in $G$ such that $\psi:W_0 \to U_0$ is a diffeomorphism. Shrinking the neighbourhoods if necessary, we may assume that $W_0 = V_0 \times S_0$, where $V_0$ and $S_0$ are neighbourhoods of $e$ in $V$ and $S$, respectively.

Let $K = S_0 \cap H$. There are two things we need to show about $K$:
1. $\psi(V_0 \times K) = H\cap U_0$
2. $K$ is a discrete set in the topology of $H$

To prove **(1)**, let $(v,s)\in V_0 \times S_0$ be arbitrary. Since $H$ is a subgroup and $V_0 \subseteq H$, it follows that $vs\in H$ if and only if $s\in H$, which is to say that $\psi(v,s)\in H\cap U_0$ if and only if $(v,s) \in V_0 \times K$. To prove **(2)**, suppose that $h\in K$. Righ translation $R_h: H\to H$ is a diffeomorphism of $H$ taking $e$ to $h$ and takin $V_0$ to a neighbourhood $V_h$ of $h$. Note that $V_h = R_h(V_0) = \psi(V_0 \times \Set{h})$, while $K = \psi(\Set{e}\times K)$. Since $\psi$ is injective on $V_0 \times S_0$, it follows that

$$
  V_h \cap K = \psi(\Set{e}\times\Set{h}) = \Set{h}
$$

Thus each point $h\in K$ is isolated in $H$, which implies that $K$ is discrete. Since $K$ is a discrete subset of the manifold $H$, it is countable, and since $H$ is closed in $G$, it follows that $K = S_0 \cap H$ is closed in $S_0$. Thus, there is a point $h_1 \in K$ that is isolated in $S_0$ (this step fails if $H$ is not closed - for example, if $H$ is a dense subgroup of the torus, then $K$ is dense in $S_0$). This means that there is a neighbourhood $S_1$ of $h_1$ in $S_0$ such that $S_1 \cap H = \Set{h_1}$. Then $U_1 = \psi(V_0 \times S_1)$ is a neighbourhood of $h_1$ in $G$ with the property that $U_1 \cap H$ is the slice $\psi(V_0 \times\Set{h_1})$ in $U_1$. The existence of such a neighbourhood for one point of $H$ implies that $H$ is embedded.

## Group actions

<MathBox title='Group action' boxType='definition'>
If $G$ is a group and $M$ is a set, a *left action* of $G$ on $M$ is a map $G\times M\to M$, often written as $(g,\mathbf{p})\mapsto g\cdot \mathbf{p}$ that satisfies
1.  $g_1\cdot (g_2\cdot \mathbf{p}) = (g_1 g_2)\cdot \mathbf{p}$ for all $g_1, g_2 \in G$ and $\mathbf{p} \in M$
2. $e\cdot \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{p}$ for all $\mathbf{p}\in M$

A *righ action* is defined analogously as a map $M\times G\to M$, written $(\mathbf{p},g)\mapsto \mathbf{p}\cdot g$, with the appropriate composition law
1.  $(\mathbf{p}\cdot g_1) \cdot g_2 = \mathbf{p}\cdot (g_1 g_2)\cdot \mathbf{p}$ for all $g_1, g_2 \in G$ and $\mathbf{p} \in M$
2. $\mathbf{p}\cdot e = \mathbf{p}$ for all $\mathbf{p}\in M$

If $M$ is a topological space and $G$ is a topological group, an action of $G$ on $M$ called a continuous action if the defining map $G\times M\to M$ or $M\times G\to M$ is continuous. In this case, $M$ is a (left or right) $G$-space. If in addition $M$ is a smooht manifold with or without boundary, $G$ is a Lie group, and the defining map is smooth, then the action is called a $smooth action$.
</MathBox>

Sometimes actions are labeled like $\theta: G\times M\to M$ and $\theta_g (\mathbf{p})$. With this notation, the conditions for a left action read
1. $\theta_{g_1} \circ\theta_{g_2} = \theta_{g_1 g_2}$
2. $\theta_e = \mathrm{id}_M$

while for a right action the first equation is replaced by 
1. $\theta_{g_2}\circ\theta_{g_2} = \theta_{g_1 g_2}$.

A right action can always be converted to a left action by the trick of defining $\mathbf{p}\cdot g$ to be $\mathbf{p} \cdot g^{-1}$. Similarly, a left action can be converted to a right action.

<MathBox title='Group action terminology' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $\theta:G\times M\to M$ is a left action of group $G$ on a set $M$.
- For each $p\in M$ the *orbit* of $p$, denoted by $G\cdot p$, is the set of all images of $p$ under the action by elements of $G$:
$$
  G\cdot p = \Set{g\cdot p | g\in G}
$$
- For each $p\in M$, the *isotropy group* or *stabilizer* of $p$, denoted by $G_p$, is the set of elements of $G$ that fix $p$:
$$
  G_p = \Set{g\in G | g\cdot p = p}
$$
The definition of a group guarantees that $G_p$ is a subgroup of $G$.
- The action is *transitive* if for every pair of points $p,q\in M$, there exists $g\in G$ such that $g\cdot p = q$, or equivalently, if the only orbit is all of $M$.
- The action is *free* if the only element of $G$ that fixes any element of $M$ is the identity: $g\cdot p = p$ for some $p\in M$ implies $g\cdot e$, or equivalently, if every isotopy group is trivial.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Automorphism group' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $E$ and $M$ are topological spaces, and that $\pi:E\to M$ is a topological covering map. An *automorphism* of $\pi$, also called a *deck/covering transformation*, is a homeomorphism $\varphi:E\to E$ such that $\pi\circ\varphi = \pi$:

$$
\begin{CD}
  E @>{\varphi}>> E \\
  @V{\pi}VV @VV{\pi}V \\
  M @= M
\end{CD}
$$

The set $\mathrm{Aut}_\pi (E)$ of all automorphisms of $\pi$, called the *automorphism group* of $\pi$, is a group under composition, acting on $E$ from the left.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $E$ and $M$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and $\pi: E\to M$ is a smooth covering map. With the discrete topology, the automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}_\pi (E)$ is a zero-dimensional Lie group acting smoothly and freely on $E$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $\varphi\in\mathrm{Aut}_\pi (E)$ is an automorphism that fixes a point $\mathbf{p}\in E$. We can consider $\varphi$ as a lift of $\pi$:

$$
\begin{CD}
  E @>{\varphi}>> E \\
  @| @VV{\pi}V \\
  E @>>{\pi}> M
\end{CD}
$$

Since the identity map of $E$ is another such lift that agrees with $\varphi$ at $\mathbf{p}$, the unique lifting property of covering maps guarantees that $\varphi = \mathrm{id}_E$. Thus, the action of $\mathrm{Aut}_\pi (E)$ is free.

To show that $\mathrm{Aut}_\pi (E)$ is a Lie group, we need only verify that is is countable. Let $q\in E$ be arbitrary, $\mathbf{p} = \pi(\mathbf{q})\in M$, and let $U\subseteq M$ be an evenly covered neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$. Because $E$ is second-countable, $\pi^{-1}(U)$ has countable many components, and because each component contains exactly one point of $\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{p})$, it follows that $\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{p})$ is countable. Let $\theta^{(\mathbf{q})}: \mathrm{Aut}_\pi (E)\to E$ be the map $\theta^{(\mathbf{q})}(\varphi) = \varphi(\mathbf{q})$. Then $\theta^{(\mathbf{q})}$ maps $\mathrm{Aut}_\pi (E)$ into $\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{p})$, and the fact that the action is free implies that it is injective, thus $\mathrm{Aut}_\pi (E)$ is countable.

### Equivariant maps

<MathBox title='Equivariant map' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $G$ is a Lie group, and that $M$ and $N$ are booth smooth manifolds endowed with smooth left or right $G$-actions. A map $F:M\to N$ is *equivariant* with respect to the given $G$-actions if for each $g\in G$

1. $F(g\cdot\mathbf{p}) = g\cdot F(\mathbf{p})$ (for left actions)
2. $F(\mathbf{p}\cdot g) = F(\mathbf{p})\cdot g$ (for right actions)

Equivalently, if $\theta$ and $\varphi$ are the given actions on $M$ and $N$, respectively, $F$ is equivariant if the following diagram commutes for eaach $g\in G$:

$$
\begin{CD}
  M @>{F}>> N \\
  @V{\theta_g}VV @VV{\varphi_g}V \\
  M @>>{F}> N
\end{CD}
$$

The condition is also expressed by saying the $F$ *intertwines* $\theta$ and $\varphi$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Equivariant rank theorem' boxType='theorem'>
Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds and let $G$ be a Lie group. Suppose that $F:M\to N$ is smooth map that is equivariant with respect to a transitive smooth $G$-action on $M$ and any smooth $G$-action on $N$. Then $F$ has constant rank. Thus, if $F$ is surjective, it is a smooth submersion; if it is injective, it is smooth immersion; and if it is bijective, it is a diffeomorphism.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\theta$ and $\varphi$ denote the $G$-actions on $M$ and $N$, respectively, and let $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ be arbitrary points in $M$. Choose $g\in G$ such that $\theta_g (\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{q}$. Because $\varphi_g \circ F = F\circ\varphi_g$, the following diagram commutes:

$$
\begin{CD}
  T_\mathbf{p}M @>{\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}}>> T_{F(\mathbf{p})}N \\
  @V{\mathrm{d}(\theta_g)_\mathbf{p}}VV @VV{\mathrm{d}(\varphi_g)_{F(\mathbf{p})}}V \\
  T_\mathbf{q} M @>>{\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{q}}> T_{F(\mathbf{q})} N
\end{CD}
$$

Because the vertical linear maps in this diagram are isomorphisms, the horizontal ones have the same rank. In other word, the rank of $F$ is the same at any two arbitrary points $\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}\in M$, so $F$ has constant rank. The final statement follows from the global rank theorem.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Orbit map' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $G$ is a Lie group, $M$ is a smooth manifold, and that $\theta:G\times M\to M$ is a smooth left action (the definition for right actions is analogous). For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, define a map $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}:G\to M$ by $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(g) = g\cdot\mathbf{p}$. This is called the *orbit map*, because its image is the orbit $G\cdot\mathbf{p}$. In addition, the preimage $\left(\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}\right)^{-1}(\mathbf{p})$ is the isotropy group $G_\mathbf{p}$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of the orbit map' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $\theta$ is a smooth left action of a Lie group $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$. For each $p\in M$, the orbit map $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}: G\to M$ is smooth and has constant rank, so the isotropy group $G_\mathbf{p} = \left(\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}\right)^{-1}(\mathbf{p})$ is a properly embedded Lie subgroup of $G$. If $G_\mathbf{p} = \Set{e}$, then $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is an injective smooth immersion, so the orbit $G\cdot\mathbf{p}$ is an immersed submanifold of $M$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The orbit map is smooth because it is equal to the composition

$$
  G\cong G\times\Set{\mathbf{p}} \hookrightarrow G\times M \xrightarrow{\theta} M
$$

It follows from the definition of a group action that $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is equivariant with respect to the action of $G$ on itself by left translation and the given action on $M$

$$
\begin{align*}
  \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(g'g) =& (g'g)\cdot \mathbf{p} = g'\cdot(g\cdot\mathbf{p}) \\
  =& g'\cdot \theta^{\mathbf{p}}(g)
\end{align*}
$$

Since $G$ acts transitively on itself, the equivariant rank theorem shows that $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ has constant rank. Thus $G_\mathbf{p}$ is a properly embedded submanifold and a Lie subgroup.

Suppose that $G_p = \Set{e}$. If $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(g') = \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(g)$, then

$$
\begin{gather*}
  g' \cdot\mathbf{p} = g\cdot \mathbf{p} \\
  \iff (g^{-1}g')\cdot\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{p} \\
  \iff g^{-1}g' = e \iff g = g'
\end{gather*}
$$

showing that $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is injective. By the equivariant rank theorem, it is a smooth immersion, and thus the orbit (endowed with a suitable topology and smooth structure) is an immersed submanifold.

### Semidirect products

<MathBox title='Semidirect product' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $H$ and $N$ are Lie groups, and that $\theta: H\times N\to N$ is a smooth left action of $H$ on $N$. It is called an *action by automorphisms* if for each $h\in H$, the map $\theta_h:N\to N$ is a group automorphism of $N$. Given such an action, we define a new Lie group $N \rtimes_\theta H$, called a *semidirect product* of $H$ and $N$ as follows. As a smooth manifold, $N \rtimes_\theta H$ is just the Cartesian product $N\times H$, but the group multiplication is defined by

$$
  (n,h)(n', h') = (n\theta_h(n'), hh')
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of semidirect products' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $H$ and $N$ are Lie groups, and that $\theta: H\times N\to N$ is a smooth action of $H$ on $N$ by automorphism. Let $G = N \rtimes_\theta H$.
1. The subsets $\tilde{N} = N\times\Set{e}$ and $\tilde{H} = \Set{e}\times H$ are closed Lie subgroups of $G$ isomorphic to $N$ and $H$, respectively.
2. $\tilde{N}$ is a normal subgroup of $\tilde{G}$
3. $\tilde{N} \cap\tilde{H} = \Set{(e,e)}$ and $\tilde{N}\tilde{H}= G$ 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Characterization of semidirect products' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $G$ is a Lie group, and that $N,H\subseteq G$ are closed Lie subgroups such that $N$ is normal, $N\cap H = \Set{e}$ and $NH = G$. Then the map $(n,h)\mapsto nh$ is a Lie group isomorphism between $N \rtimes_\theta H$ and $G$, where $\theta: H\times N\to N$ is the action by conjugation: $\theta_h (n) = hnh^{-1}$.
</MathBox>

### Representations

<MathBox title='Linear action' boxType='definition'>
Let $G$ be a Lie group and $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space. An action of $G$ on $V$ is called a *linear action* if for each $g\in G$, the map from $V$ to itself given by $x\mapsto g\cdot x$ is linear.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $G$ be a Lie group and $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space. A smooth left action of $G$ on $V$ is linear if and only if it is of the form $g\cdot x = \rho(g)x$ for some representation $\rho$ of $G$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Every action induced by a representation is evidently linear. To prove the converse, assumme that we are given a linear action of $G$ on $V$. The hypothesis implies that for each $g\in G$ there is a linear map $\rho(g) \in \mathrm{GL}(V)$ such that $g\cdot x = \rho(g)x$ for all $x\in V$. The fact that the action satisfies the left action properties translates to $\rho(g_1 g_2) = \rho(g_1)\rho(g_2)$, so $\rho: G\to \mathrm{GL}(V)$ is a group homomorphism. Thus, to show that it is a Lie group representation, we need only show that it is smooth.

Choose a basis $\Set{\mathbf{e}_i}$ for $V$, and for each $i$ let $\pi^i: V\to\R$ be the projection onto the $i$th coordinate with respect to this basis: $\pi^i (x^j \mathbf{e}_j) = x^i$. If we let $\rho_j^i(g)$ denote the matrix entries of $\rho(g)$ with respect to this basis, it follows that $\rho_j^i(g) = \pi^i (g\cdot\mathbf{e}_i)$, so each function $\rho_j^i$ is a composition of smooth function. Because the matrix entries form global smooth coordinates for $\mathrm{GL}(V)$ ,this implies that $\rho$ is smooth.

# Vector fields

<MathBox title='Vector field' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, a *vector field* on $M$ is a section of the map $\pi:TM\to M$. More specifically, a vector field is a continuous map $X:M\to TM$, usually written $\mathbf{p}\mapsto X_\mathbf{p}$, with the property that

$$
  \pi\circ X = \mathrm{id}_M
$$

or equivalently, $X_\mathbf{p}\in T_\mathbf{p}M$ for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$. If $X$ is smooth it is a *smooth vector field*, otherwise it is called a *rough vector field*. The set of all smooth vector fields on $M$, denoted $\mathfrak{X}(M)$, is a vector space under pointwise addition and scalar multiplication:

$$
  (\alpha X + \beta Y)_\mathbf{p} = \alpha X_\mathbf{p} + \beta Y_\mathbf{p},\; \alpha,\beta\in\R
$$

The zero element of this vector space is the zero vector field, whose value at each $\mathbf{p}\in M$ is $\mathbf{0}\in T_\mathbf{p}M$. In addition, smooth vector fields can be multiplied by smooth real-valued functions: if $f\in C^\infty(M)$ and $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$, we define $fX:M\to TM$ by

$$
  (fX)_\mathbf{p} = f(\mathbf{p})X_\mathbf{p}
$$

The support of $X$ is defined as

$$
  \mathrm{supp}(X) = \overline{\Set{\mathbf{p}\in M | X_\mathbf{p} \neq \mathbf{0}}}
$$

A vector field is *compactly supported* if its support is a compact set. 

If $U\subseteq M$ is an arbitrary subset, a *vector field along* $U$ is a continuous map $X:A\to TM$ satisfying

$$
  \pi\circ X = \mathrm{id}_U
$$

or equivalently, $X_\mathbf{p}\in T_\mathbf{p}M$ for each $\mathbf{p}\in U$. The vector field along $U$ is smooth if for each $\mathbf{p}\in U$ there is a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ in $M$ and a smooth vector field $\tilde{X}$ on $V$ that agrees with $X$ on $V \cap U$.
</MathBox>

Suppose that $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary. If $X:M\to TM$ is a rough vector field and $(U, (x^i))$ is any smooth coordinate chart for $M$, we can write $X$ at any point $\mathbf{p}\in U$ in terms of the coordinate basis vectors:

$$

<MathBox title='Smoothness criterion for vector fields' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and let $X:M\to TM$ be a rough vector field. If $(U, (x^i))$ is any smooth coordinate chart on $M$, then the restriction of $X$ to $U$ is smooth if and only if its component functions with respect tor this chart are smooth.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $(x^i, v^i)$ be the natural coordinates on $\pi^{-1}(U)\subseteq TM$ associated with the chart $(U,(x^i))$. By definition of natural coordinates, the coordinate representation of $X:M\to TM$ on $U$ is

$$
  \hat{X}(\mathbf{p}) = (x^i,\dots,x^n,X^1(\mathbf{x}),\dots,X^n(\mathbf{x}))

where $X^i$ is the $i$th component function of $X$ in $x^i$-coordinates. It follows immediately that smoothness of $X$ in $U$ is equivalent to smoothness of its component functions.

The assignment $\mathbf{p}\mapsto\mathbf{v}$ is an example of a vector field along the set $\Set{\mathbf{p}}$. It is smooth because it can be extended to a constant-coefficient vector field in a coordinate neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$.

## Local and global frames

<MathBox title='Linear independence' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary. An ordered $k$-tuple $(X_1,\dots,X_k)$ of vector fields defined on some subset $A\subseteq M$ is *linearly independent* if $(X_1|_\mathbf{p},\dots, X_k|_\mathbf{p})$ is a linearly independent $k$-tuple in $T_\mathbf{p} M$ for each $\mathbf{p}\in A$. The $k$-tuple $(X_1,\dots,X_k)$ of vector fields *spans* the tangent bundle $TM$ if the $k$-tuple $(X_1|_\mathbf{p},\dots,X_k|\mathbf{p})$ spans $T_\mathbf{p}M$ for each $\mathbf{p}$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Frame' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary. A *local frame* for $M$ is an ordered $n$-tuple of vector fields $(E_i)_{i=1}^n$ defined on an open subset $U\subseteq M$ that is linearly independent and spans the tangent bundle. Thus, the vectors $(E_i|_\mathbf{p})_{i=1}^n$ form a basis for $T_p M$ at each $\mathbf{p}$. It is called a *global frame* if $U = M$, and a *smooth frame* if each of the vector fields $E_i$ is smooth. If $M$ admits a smooth global frame, it is called *parallelizable*.

In particular, if $M = \R^n$, then a $k$-tuple of vector fields $(E_i)_{i=1}^k$ defined on some subset $A\subseteq\R^n$ is *orthonormal* if for each $\mathbf{p}\in A$, the vectors $(E_i|_\mathbf{p})_{i=1}^k$ are orthonormal with respect to the Euclidean inner product. A (local/global) frame consisiting of orthonormal vector fields is called an *orthonormal field*.

If $(X_i)_{i=1}^k$ is a linearly independent $k$-tuple of smooth vector fields on an open subset $U\subseteq M$ with $1\geq k < n$, then for each $\mathbf{p}\in U$ there exis smooth vector fields $X_{k+1},\dots,X_n$ in a neighbourhood $V$ of $\mathbf{p}$ such that $(X_i)_{i=1}^n$ is a smooth local frame for $M$ on $U\cap V$.
2. If $(\mathbf{v}_i)_{i=1}^k$ is a linearly independent $k$-tuple of vectors in $T_\mathbf{p}M$ for some $\mathbf{p}\in M$ with $1\leq k < n$, then there exists a smooth local frame $(X_i)_{i=1}^k$ on a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ such that $X_i|\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{v}_i$. 
3. If $(X_i)_{i=1}^n$ is a linearly independent $n$-tuple of smooth vector fields along a closed subset $A\subseteq M$, then there exists a smooth local fram $(\tilde{X}_1)_{i=1}^n$ on some neighbourhood of $A$ such that $\tilde{X}_i|_A = X_i$.

<MathBox title='Gram-Schmidt algorithm for frames' boxType='lemma'>
Suppose that $(X_i)_{i=1}^n$ is a smooth local frame for $T\R^n$ over an open subset $U\subseteq \R^n$. Then there is a smooth orthonormal frame $(E_i)_{i=1}^n$ over $U$ such that for each $\mathbf{p}\in U$

$$
  \mathrm{span}(E_i|_\mathbf{p})_{i=1}^n = \mathrm{span}(X_i|_\mathbf{p})_{i=1}^n
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Applying the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to the vectors $(X_j|_\mathbf{p})$ at each $\mathbf{p}\in U$, we obtain an $n$-tuple of rough vector fields $(E_i)_{i=1}^n$ given inductively by

$$
  E_j = \frac{X_j - \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} (X_j \cdot E_i)E_i}{|X_j - \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} (X_j \cdot E_i)E_i|},\; j=1,\dots,n
$$

For eahc $j=1,\dots,n$ and each $\mathbf{p}\in U$, then $X_j|_\mathbf{p}\notin \mathrm{span}(E_1|_\mathbf{p},\dots,E_{j-1}|_\mathbf{p})$, so the denominator above is a nowhere-vanishing smooth function on $U$. Thus, this formula defines $(E_i)_{i=1}^n$ as a smooth orthonormal frame on $U$.

## Vector fields as derivations of $C^\infty (M)$

Vector fields define operators on the space of smooth real-valued functions. Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. If $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ and $f\in C^\infty (U)$ is a smooth real-valued function defined on an open subset $U\subseteq M$, we obtain a new function $Xf:U\to\R$ defined By

$$
  (Xf)(\mathbf{p}) = X_\mathbf{p}f
$$

In particular, for any open subset $V \subseteq U$

$$
  (Xf)|_V = X(f|_V)
$$

<MathBox title='Smoothness criterion for vector fields' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and let $X:M\to TM$ be a rough vector field. The following are equivalent:
1. $X$ is smooth
2. for every $f\in C^\infty (M)$, the function $Xf$ is smooth on $M$
3. for every open subset $U\subseteq M$ and every $f\in C^\infty (M)$, the function $Xf$ is smooth on $U$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1)** $\implies$ **(2)**<br/>
Assume that $X$ is smooth, and let $f\in C^\infty(M)$. For any $\mathbf{p}\in M$, we can choose smooth coordinates $(x^i)$ on a neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{p}$. Then for $\mathbf{x}\in U$, we can write

$$
  Xf(\mathbf{x}) = \left( X^i(\mathbf{x})\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{x} \right)f = X^i(\mathbf{x})\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{x})
$$

Since the component functions $X^i$ are smooth on $U$, if follows that $Xf$ is smooth in $U$. Since the same is true in a neighbourhood of each point, $Xf$ is smooth on $M$.

**(2)** $\implies$ **(3)**<br/>
Suppose that $U\subseteq M$ is open and $f\in C^\infty (U)$. For any $\mathbf{p}\in U$, let $\psi$ be a smooth bump function that is equal to $1$ in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ and supported in $U$, and define $\tilde{f} = \psi f$, extended to be zero on $M\setminus\mathrm{supp}(\psi)$. Then $X\tilde{f}$ is smooth by assumption, and is equal to $Xf$ in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$. This shows that $Xf$ is smooth in a neighbourhood of each point of $U$.

**(3)** $\implies$ **(1)**<br/>
Suppose that $Xf$ is smooth whenever $f$ is smooth on an open subset of $M$. If $(x^i)$ are any smooth local coordinates on $U\subseteq M$, we can think of each coordinate $x^i$ as a smooth function on $U$. Applying $X$ to one of these functions, we obtain

$$
  Xx^i = X^j \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}(x^i) = X^i
$$

Because $Xx^i$ is smooth by assumption, it follows that the component functions of $X$ are smooth, so $X$ is smooth.

<MathBox title='Vector fields are derivations' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. A map $D:C^\infty(M) \to C^\infty(M)$ is a derivation if and only if it is of the form $Df = Xf$ for some smooth vector field $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

A smooth vector field $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ defines a map from $C^\infty(M)$ to itself by $f\mapsto Xf$. This map is clearly linear over $\R$ and satisfies the product rule

$$
\begin{align*}
  (Xfg)(\mathbf{p}) =& X_\mathbf{p}(fg) = \left(X^i (\mathbf{p})\left.\frac{\partial }{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p}\right)fg \\
  =& X^i (\mathbf{p}) \frac{\partial fg}{\partial x^i} (\mathbf{p}) \\
  =& X^i (\mathbf{p}) \left(f(\mathbf{p})\frac{\partial g}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p}) +  g(\mathbf{p}) \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p}) \right) \\
  =& f(\mathbf{p}) X^i (\mathbf{p})\frac{\partial g}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p}) + g(\mathbf{p}) X^i (\mathbf{p})\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p}) \\
  =& f(\mathbf{p}) X_\mathbf{p}g + g(\mathbf{p})X_\mathbf{p} f
\end{align*}
$$

showing that that $X$ induces a derivation.

Conversely, suppose that $D:C^\infty (M)$. We need to construct a vector field $X$ such that $Df = Xf$ for all $f$. If there is such a vector field, its value at $\mathbf{p}$ must be the derivation at $\mathbf{p}$ whose action on any smooth real-valued function $f\in C^\infty(M)$ is given by

$$
  X_\mathbf{p}f = (Df)(\mathbf{p})
$$

The linearity of $D$ guarantees that this expression depends linearly on $f$, and the fact that $D$ is a derivation yields the product rule for tangent vectors. Thus, the map $X_\mathbf{p}:C^\infty(M) \to\R$ so defined is indeed a tangent vector, i.e. a derivation of $C^\infty(M)$ at $\mathbf{p}$. This defines $X$ as a rough vector field. Because $Xf = DF$ is smooth whenever $f\in C^\infty (M)$, this vector field is smooth.

## Vector fields and smooth maps

<MathBox title='Related vector fields' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds with or without boundary. Suppose that $F:M\to N$ is smooth and that $X$ is a vector field on $M$. If there is a vector field $Y$ on $N$ such that $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(X_\mathbf{p}) = Y_{F(\mathbf{p})}$ for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, we say that $X$ and $Y$ are $F$-related. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $F$ is a smooth map between manifolds with or without boundary, $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$, and $Y \in\mathfrak{X}(N)$. Then $X$ and $Y$ are $F$-related if and only if for every smooth real-valued function $f$ defined on an open subset of $N$

$$
  X(f\circ F) = (Yf) \circ F
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

For any $\mathbf{p}\in M$ and any smooth real-value $f$ defined in a neighbourhood of $F(\mathbf{p})$

$$
  X(f\circ F)(\mathbf{p}) = X_p(f\circ F) = \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(X_\mathbf{p})f
$$

while

$$
  (Yf)\circ F(\mathbf{p}) = (Yf)(F(\mathbf{p})) = Y_{F(\mathbf{p})}f
$$

Thus, the first expression is true for all $f$ if and only if $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(X_\mathbf{p}) = Y_{F(\mathbf{p})}$ for all $\mathbf{p}\in M$, i.e. if and only if $X$ and $Y$ are $F$-related.

<MathBox title='Existence of unique related vector fields' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boudary, and $F:M\to N$ is a diffeomorphism. For every $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$, there is a unique smooth vector field on $N$ that is $F$-related to $X$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

For $Y\in\mathfrak{X}(N)$ to be $F$-related to $X$ means that $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(X_\mathbf{p}) = Y_{F(\mathbf{p})}$ for every $\mathbf{p}\in M$. If $F$ is a diffeomorphism, therefore, we define $Y$ by

$$
  Y_\mathbf{q} = \mathrm{d}F_{F^{-1}(\mathbf{q})}(X_{F^{-1}(\mathbf{q})})
$$

It is clear that $Y$, so defined, is the unique (rough) vector field that is $F$-related to $X$. Note that $Y:N\to TN$ is the composition of the following smooth maps:

$$
  N \xrightarrow{F^{-1}} M \xrightarrow{X} TM \xrightarrow{\mathrm{d}F} TN 
$$

It follows that $Y$ is smooth.
</details>
</MathBox>

Let $F:M\to N$ be a diffeomorphism between smooth manifolds and consider a vector field $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$. The unique vector field that is $F$-related to $X$ is usually denoted $F_* X$ and is called the *pushforward* of $X$ by $F$. The $F$-related vector $F_* X$ is explicitly defined By

$$
  (F_* X)_\mathbf{q} = \mathrm{d}F_{F^{-1}(\mathbf{q})} (X_{F^{-1}(\mathbf{q})})
$$

<MathBox title='' boxType='corollary'>
Suppose that $F:M\to N$ is a diffeomorphism and $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$. For any $f\in C^\infty(N)$

## Vector fields and submanifolds

<MathBox title='Tangent vector field' boxType='definition'>
Let $S\subseteq M$ be an immersed or embedded submanifold (with or without boundary). Given a point $\mathbf{p}\in S$, a vector field $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ is *tangent* to $S$ at $\mathbf{p}$ if $X_\mathbf{p}\in T_\mathbf{p}S \subseteq T_\mathbf{p}M$. It is tangent to $S$ if it is tangent to $S$ at every point of $S$.

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold, $S\subseteq M$ be an embedded submanifold with or without boundary, and let $X$ be a smooth vector field on $M$. Then $X$ is tangent to $S$ if and only if $(Xf)|_S = 0$ for every $f\in C^\infty (M)$ such that $f|_S \equiv 0$.

<MathBox title='Restricting vector fields to submanifolds' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold, $S\subseteq M$ be an immersed submanifold with or without boundary, and let $\iota:S\hookrightarrow M$ denote the inclusion map. If $Y\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ is tangent to $S$, then there is a unique smooth vector field on $S$, denoted by $Y|_S$, that is $\iota$-related to $Y$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The fact that $Y$ is tangent to $S$ means by definition that $Y_\mathbf{p}$ is in the image of $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}$ for each $\mathbf{p}\in S$. Thus, for each $\mathbf{p}$ there is a vector $X_\mathbf{p} \in T_\mathbf{p}S$ such that $Y_\mathbf{p} = \mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}(X_\mathbf{p})$. Since $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}$ is injective, $X_\mathbf{p}$ is unique, so this defines $X$ as a rough vector field on $S$. If we can show that $X$ is smooth, it is the unique vector field that is $\iota$-related to $Y$. It suffices to show that it is smooth in a neighbourhood of each point.

Let $\mathbf{p}$ be any point in $S$. Since an immersed submanifold (with or without boundary) is locally embedded, there is a neighbourhood $V$ of $\mathbf{p}$ in $S$ that is embedded in $M$. Let $(U, (x^i))$ be a slice chart (or boundary slice chart) for $V$ in $M$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$, so that $V\cap U$ is the subset where $x^{k+1} = \cdots = x^n = 0$ (and $x^k \geq 0$ if $\partial S$), and $(x^1,\dots,x^k)$ for local coordinates for $S$ in $V \cap U$. If $Y = \sum_{i=1}^n Y^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$ in these coordinates it follows from our construction that $X$ has the coordinate representation $Y = \sum_{i=1}^k Y^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$, which is clearly smooth on $V \cap U$.

  [X,Y]_\mathbf{p} f = X_\mathbf{p} (Yf) - Y_\mathbf{p}(Xf)

Let $X = X^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$ and $Y = Y^j \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}$ be the coordinate expression for $X$ and $Y$ in terms of some smooth local coordinates $(x^i)$ for $M$. Then $[X,Y]$ has the following coordinate expression

  [X,Y] = \left( X^i \frac{\partial Y^j}{\partial x^i} - Y^i \frac{\partial X^j}{\partial x^i} \right)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}

$$
  [X,Y] = (XY^j - YX^j)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}

Since $[X,Y]$ is a smooth vector field, its action on a function is determined locally: $([X,Y]f)|_U = [X,Y](f|_U)$. Thus it suffices to compute in a single smooth chart, where we have

Since $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are $F$-related

  (L_g)_* [X,Y] = [(L_g)_* X, (L_g)_* Y] = [X, Y]
$$

Thus, $[X,Y]$ is $L_g$-related to itself for each $g$, meaning that it is left-invariant.

<MathBox title='Lie algebra' boxType='definition'>
A *Lie algebra* over $\R$ is a real vector space $\mathfrak{g}$ endowed with a map called the *bracket* from $\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g}$ to $g$, denoted by $(X,Y)\mapsto [X,Y]$, that satisfies the following properties for all $X,Y,Z\in\mathfrak{g}$:
1. **Bilinearity:** For $a,b\in\R$:
    - $[aX + bY, Z] = a[X,Z] + b[Y,Z]$
    - $[Z, aX + bY] = a[Z,X] + b[Z,Y]$
2. **Antisymmetry:** $[X,Y] = - [Y,X]$
3. **Jacobi identity:** 
$$
  [X,[Y,Z]] + [Y,[Z,X]] + [Z,[X,Y]] = 0
$$

A linear subspace $\mathfrak{h}\subseteq\mathfrak{g}$ is called a *Lie subalgebra of* $\mathfrak{g}$ if it is closed under brackets. In this case $\mathfrak{h}$ is itself a Lie algebra with the restriction of the same bracket.

If $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathfrak{h}$ are Lie algebras, a linear map $A:\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{h}$ is called a *Lie algebra homomorphism* if it preserves bracket: $A[X,Y] = [AX, AY]$. An invertible Lie algebra homomorphism is called a *Lie algebra isomorphism*. If there exists a Lie algebra isomorphism from $\mathfrak{g}$ to $\mathfrak{h}$, then they are *isomorphic* as Lie algebras.

The Lie algebra of all smooth left-invariant vector fields on a Lie group $G$ is called the Lie algebra of $G$ and is denoted $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$. A local or global frame consisting of left-invariant vector fields is called a *left-invariant frame*.

<MathBox title='' boxType='theorem'>
Let $G$ be a Lie group. The evaluation map $\varepsilon: \mathrm{Lie}(G)\to T_e G$ given by $\varepsilon(X) = X_e$ is a vector space isomorphism. Thus, $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ is finite-dimensional, with $\dim(\mathrm{Lie}(G)) = \dim(G)$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

It is clear from the definition that $\varepsilon$ is linear over $\R$. First, we show that $\varepsilon$ is injective. If $\varepsilon(X) = X_e = 0$ for some $X\in\mathrm{Lie}(G)$, the left-invariance of $X$ implies that $X_g = \mathrm{d}(L_g)_e(X_e) = 0$ for every $g\in G$, so $X = 0$.

To show that $\varepsilon$ is surjective, let $\mathbf{v}\in T_e G$ be arbitrary, and define a (rough) vector field $\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}$ on $G$ by

$$
  \mathbf{v}^{\mathbf{L}}|_g = \mathrm{d}(L_g)_e(\mathbf{v})
$$

If there is a left-invariant vector field on $G$ whose value at the identity is $\mathbf{v}$, clearly it has to be given by this formula.

First we need to check that $\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}$ is smooth. It suffices to show that $\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}f$ is smooth whenever $f\in C^\infty(G)$. Choose a smooth curve $\gamma:(-\delta,\delta)\to G$ such that $\gamma(0) = e$ and $\gamma'(0) = \mathbf{v}$. Then for all $g\in G$,

$$
\begin{align*}
  \left(\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L} f\right)(g) =& \mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}|_g f = \mathrm{d}(L_g)_e (\mathbf{v}) f \\
  =& \mathbf{v}(f\circ L_g) = \gamma'(0)(f\circ L_g) \\
  =& \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t=0} (f\circ L_g \circ \gamma)(t)
\end{align*}
$$

If we define $\varphi: (-\delta, \delta)\times G \to\R$ by $\varphi(t, g) = f\circ L_g \circ \gamma(t) = f(g\gamma(t))$, the computation above shows that $\left(\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L} f\right) = \frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t}(0,g)$. Because $\varphi$ is a composition of group multiplication, $f$ and $\gamma$, it is smooth. It follows that $\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t}(0,g)$ depends smoothly on $g$, so $\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}$ is smooth.

Next, we show that $\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}$ is left-invariant, which is to say that $\mathrm{d}(L_h)_g \left(\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}|_g \right) = \mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}|_{hg}$ for all $g,h\in G$. This follows from the definition of $\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}$ and the fact that $L_h \circ L_g = L_{hg}$:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}(L_h)_g \left(\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}|_g \right) =& \mathrm{d}(L_h)_g \circ \mathrm{d}(L_g)_e (\mathbf{v}) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(L_h \circ L_g)_e (\mathbf{v}) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(L_{hg}_e(\mathbf{v})) \\
  =& \mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}|_{hg}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, $\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}\in\mathrm{Lie}(G)$. Since $L_e$ (left translation by the identity) is the identity map of $G$, it follows that $\varepsilon\left(\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}\right) = \mathbf{v}^\mathrm{L}|_e = \mathbf{v}$, so $\varepsilon$ is surjective.

The composition of the natural maps

$$
  \mathrm{Lie}(\mathrm{GL}(n,\R)) \to T_{I_n}GL(n,\R) \to\mathfrak{gl}(n,\R)
$$

gives a Lie algebra isomorphism between $\mathrm{Lie}(\mathrm{GL}(n,\R))$ and the matrix algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\R)$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Using the matrix entries $X_j^i$ as global coordinates on $\mathrm{GL}(n,\R)\subseteq \mathfrak{gl}(n,\R)$, the natural isomorphism $T_{I_n}\mathrm{GL}(n,\R) \cong \mathfrak{gl}(n,\R)$ takes the formal

$$
  A_j^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial X_j^i}\right|_{I_n} \leftrightarrow (A_j^i)
$$

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ denote the Lie algebra of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\R)$. Any matrix $A = (A_j^i)\in\mathfrak{gl}(n,\R)$ determines a left-invariant vector field $A^\mathrm{L}\in\mathfrak{g}$ given by

$$
  A^\mathrm{L}|_X = \mathrm{d}(L_X)_{I_n}(A) = \mathrm{d}(L_X)_{I_n}\left( A_j^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial X_j^i}\right|_{I_n} \right)
$$

Since $L_X$ is the restriction to $\mathrm{GL}(n,\R)$ of the linear map $A\mapsto XA$ on $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\R)$, its differential is represented in coordinates by exactly the same linear map. In other words, the left invariant vector field $A^\mathrm{L}$ determined by $A$ is the one whose value at $X\in\mathrm{GL}(n,\R)$ is

$$
  A^\mathrm{L}|_X = X_j^i A_k^j \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial X_k^i}\right|_X
$$

Given two matrices $A,B\in \mathfrak{gl}(n,\R)$, the Lie bracket of the corresponding left-invariant vector fields is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \left[A^\mathrm{L}, B^\mathrm{L} \right] =& \left[ X_j^i A_k^j\frac{\partial}{\partial X_k^i}, X_q^p B_r^q \frac{\partial}{\partial X_r^p} \right] \\
  =& X_j^i A_k^j \frac{\partial}{\partial X_k^i}\left(X_q^p B_r^q \right) - X_q^p \frac{\partial}{\partial X_r^p}\left( X_j^i A_k^j \right)\frac{\partial}{\partial X_k^i} \\
  =& X_j^i A_k^j B_r^k \frac{\partial}{\partial X_r^i} - X_q^p B_r^q A_k^r \frac{\partial}{\partial X_k^p} \\
  =& \left( X_j^i A_k^j B_r^k - X_j^i B_k^j A_r^k \right)\frac{\partial}{\partial X_r^i}
\end{align*}
$$

where we have use the fact that $\frac{\partial X_q^p}{\partial X_k^i} = \delta_{kq}^{ip}$, and that $A_j^i$ and $B_j^i$ are constants. Evalutating the last expression when $X$ is equal to the identity matrix we get

$$
  \left[A^\mathrm{L}, B^\mathrm{L} \right] = \left(A_k^i B_r^k - B_k^i A_r^k \right)\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial X_r^i}\right|_{I_n}
$$

This is the vector corresponding to the matrix commutator bracket $[A, B]$. Since the left-invariant vector field $\left[ A^\mathrm{L}, B^\mathrm{L} \right]$ is determined by its value at the idenitity, this implies that

$$
  \left[A^\mathrm{L}, B^\mathrm{L} \right] = [A, B]^\mathbf{L}
$$

which is precisely the statement that the composite map is a Lie algebra isomorphism.

### Induced Lie algebra homomorphisms

<MathBox title='Induced Lie algebra homomorphisms' boxType='theorem'>
Let $G$ and $H$ be Lie groups, and let $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathfrak{h}$ be their Lie algebras. Suppose that $F:G\to H$ is a Lie group homomorphism. For every $X\in\mathfrak{g}$, there is a unique vector field in $\mathfrak{h}$ that is $F$-related to $X$. With this vector field denoted by $F_* X$, the map $F_*:\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{h}$ so defined is an induced Lie algebra homomorphism.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If there is any vector field $Y\in\mathfrak{h}$ that is $F$-related to $X$, it must satisfy $Y_e = \mathrm{d}F_e (X_e)$, and thus it must be uniquely determined by

$$
  Y = (\mathrm{d}F_d (X_e))^\mathrm{L}
$$

To that this $Y$ is $F$-related to $X$, we note that the fact that $F$ is a homomorphism implies

$$
\begin{align*}
  F(gg') = F(g)F(g') \implies& F(L_g g') = L_{F(g)} F(g') \\
  \implies& F\circ L_g = L_{F(g)} \circ F \\
  \implies& \mathrm{d}F \circ \mathrm{d}(L_g) = \mathrm{d}(L_{F(g)})\circ \mathrm{d}F
\end{align*}
$$

Thus

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}F(X_g) =& \mathrm{d}F(\mathrm{d}(L_g)(X_e)) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(L_{F(g)})(\mathrm{d}F(X_e)) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(L_{F(g)})(Y_e) = Y_{F(g)}
\end{align*}
$$

This shows that $X$ and $Y$ are $F$-related.

For each $X\in\mathfrak{g}$, let $F_* X$ denote the unique vector field in $\mathfrak{h}$ that is $F$-related to $X$. It then follows immediately from the naturality of Lie brackets that $F_*[X,Y] = [F_* X, F_* Y]$, so $F_*$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism.

<MathBox title='Properties of induced homomorphisms' boxType='proposition'>
1. The homomorphism $(\mathrm{id}_G)_*: \mathrm{Lie}(G)\to\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ induced by the identity map of $G$ is the identity of $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$.
2. If $F_1: G\to H$ and $F_2:H\to K$ are Lie group homomorphisms, Then
$$
  (F_2 \circ F_1)_* = (F_2)_* \circ (F_1)_*: \mathrm{Lie}(G) \to\mathrm{Lie}(K)
$$
3. Isomorphic Lie groups have isomorphic Lie algebras.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Both of the relations $\mathrm{d}(\mathrm{id}_G)_e = \mathrm{id}_{T_e G}$ and $\mathrm{d}(F_2 \circ F_1)_e = \mathrm{d}(F_2)_e \circ \mathrm{d}(F_1)_e$ hold for differentials. Since the induced homomorphism is determined by the differential at the identity, this proves **(1)** and **(2)**. If $F:G\to H$ is an isomorphism, **(1)** and **(2)** together imply that 

$$
  F_* \circ (F^{-1})_* = (F\circ F^{-1})_* = \mathrm{id} = (F^{-1})_* \circ F_*
$$

so $F_*:\mathrm{Lie}(G) \to\mathrm{Lie}(H)$ is an isomorphism.

### The Lie algebra of a Lie subgroup

<MathBox title='The Lie algebra of a Lie subgroup' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $H\subseteq G$ is a Lie subgroup, and $\iota:H\hookrightarrow G$ is the inclusion map. There is a Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}\subseteq \mathrm{Lie}(G)$ that is canonically isomorphic to $\mathrm{Lie}(H)$ characterized by either of the following descriptions

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathfrak{h} =& \iota_* (\mathrm{Lie}(H)) \\
  =& \Set{X\in\mathrm{Lie}(G) | X_e \in T_e H}
\end{align*}
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Because the inclusion map $\iota:H\hookrightarrow G$ is a Lie group homomorphism, $\iota_*(\mathrm{Lie}(H))$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$. By definition of the induced Lie algebra homomorphism, this subalgebra is precisely the set of left-invariant vector fields on $G$ whose values at the identity are of the form $\mathrm{d}\iota_e (\mathbf{v})$ for some $\mathbf{v}\in T_e H$. Since the differential $\mathrm{d}\iota_e: T_e H \to T_e G$ is the inclusion of $T_e H$ as a subspace in $T_e G$, the two characterizations of $\mathfrak{h}$ given in the hypothesis are eqial. Since $\mathrm{d}\iota_e$ is injective on $T_e H$, it follows that $\iota_*$ is injective on $\mathrm{Lie}(H)$; since it is surjective by definition of $\mathfrak{h}$, it is an isomorphism between $\mathrm{Lie}(H)$ and $\mathfrak{h}$.

$$

yields a Lie algebra isomorphism between $\mathrm{Lie}(\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{C})$ and the matrix algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C})$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The Lie group homomorphism $\beta: \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C}) \to\mathrm{GL}(2n,\R)$ defined by replacing each complex matrix entry $a + ib$ with the $2\times 2$ skew symmetric block

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  a & -b \\
  b & a
\end{bmatrix}
$$

induces a Lie algebra homomorphism

$$
  \beta_*: \mathrm{Lie}(\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})) \to \mathrm{Lie}(\mathrm{GL}(2n,\R))
$$

Composing $\beta_*$ with the canonical isomorphisms in the hypothesis yields a commutative diagram

$$
\begin{CD}
  \mathrm{Lie}(\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})) @>{\varepsilon}>> T_{I_n} \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{C}) @>{\psi}>> \mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C}) \\
  @V{\beta_*}VV @VV{\mathrm{d}\beta_{I_n}}V @VV{\alpha}V \\
  \mathrm{Lie}(\mathrm{GL}(2n, \R)) @>>{\varepsilon}> T_{I_{2n}}\mathrm{GL}(2n,\R) @>>{\psi}> \mathfrak{gl}(2n,\R)
\end{CD}
$$

in which $\alpha = \varphi\circ\mathrm{d}\beta_{I_n}\circ\varphi^{-1}$. The isomorphisms in the bottom row of the commutative diagram is a Lie algebra isomorphism for $\mathrm{GL}(2n, \R)$. It remains to show that the top row is also a Lie algrebra isomorphism.

It is easy to see that $\beta$ is (the restriction of) a linear. It follows that $\mathrm{d}\beta_{I_n}: T_{I_n} \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C}) \to T_{I_{2n}} \mathrm{GL}(2n,\R)$ is given by exactly the same formula as $\beta$, as is $\alpha: \mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C}) \to\mathfrak{gl}(2n,\R)$. Because $\beta(AB) = \beta(A)\beta(B)$, it follows that $\alpha$ preserves matrix commutators

$$
\begin{align*}
  \alpha[A,B] =& \alpha(AB - BA) \\
  =& \alpha(A)\alpha(B) - \alpha(B)\alpha(A) \\
  =& [\alpha(A), \alpha(B)]
\end{align*}
$$

Thus $\alpha$ is an injective Lie algebra homomorphism from $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C})$ to $\mathfrak{gl}(2n,\R)$. Replacing the bottom row of the commutative diagram by the images of the vertical maps, we obtain a commutative diagram of vector space isomorphisms

$$
  \mathrm{Lie}(\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})) @>{\cong}>> \mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C}) \\
  @V{\beta_*}VV @VV{\alpha}V \\
  \beta_* (\mathrm{Lie}(\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C}))) @>>{\cong}> \alpha(\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C}))
$$

in which the bottom map and the two vertical maps are Lie algebra isomorphisms. It follows that the top maps is also a Lie algebra isomorphism.

<details>

Suppose first that $X$ and $Y$ are $F$-related, and that $\gamma:I\to M$ is an integral curve of $X$. We define $\sigma:I\to N$ by $\sigma = F\circ\gamma$, then

$$
\begin{align*}

so $\sigma$ is an integral curve of $F$.

Conversely, suppose that $F$ takes integral curves of $X$ to integral curves of $Y$. Given $\mathbf{p}\in M$, let $\gamma:(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \to M$ be an integral curve of $X$ starting at $\mathbf{p}$. Since $F\circ\gamma$ is an integral curve of $Y$ starting at $F(\mathbf{p})$, we have

$$
  Y_{F(\mathbf{p})} = (F\circ\gamma)'(0) = \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(\gamma'(0)) = \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(X_\mathbf{p})

## Flows

<MathBox title='Global flow' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. A *global flow* on $M$, also called a *one-parameter group action*, is a continuous left $\R$-action on $M$. That is, a continuous map $\theta:\R\times M\to M$ satisfying the following properties for all $s,t\in\R$ and $\mathbf{p}\in M$.
1. $\theta(t, \theta(s,\mathbf{p})) = \theta(t + s,\mathbf{p})$
2. $\theta(0,\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{p}$

Given a global flow $\theta$ on $M$, we define two collections of maps as follows:
1. For each $t\in\R$, define a continuous map $\theta_t: M\to M$ by
$$
  \theta_t (\mathbf{p}) = \theta(t,\mathbf{p})
$$
The defining properties above are equivalent the the *group laws*
- $\theta_t \circ \theta_s = \theta_{t+s}$
- $\theta_0 = \mathrm{id}_M$

As is the case for any continuous group action, each map $\theta_t: M\to M$ is a homomorphism, and if the flow is smooth, $\theta_t$ is a diffeomorphism.

2. For each $p\in M$, define a curve $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}:\R\to M$ by
$$
  \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t) = \theta(t,\mathbf{p})
$$
The image of this curve is the orbit of $\mathbf{p}$ under the group action.

To show that $V$ is smooth, it suffices to show that $Vf$ is smooth for every $f \in C^\infty(U)$ defined on an open subset $U\subseteq M$. For any such $f$, and any $\mathbf{p}\in U$, note that

$$
\begin{align*}
  Vf(\mathbf{p}) =& V_\mathbf{p}f = \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}'(0)f \\
  =& \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right_{t=0} f(\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t)) \\
  =& \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right|_{(0,\mathbf{p})} f(\theta(t, \mathbf{p}))
\end{align*}
$$

Because $f(\theta(t,\mathbf{p}))$ is a smooth function of $(t,\mathbf{p})$ by composition, so is its partial derivative with respect to $t$. Thus $Vf(\mathbf{p})$ depends smooth on $\mathbf{p}$, so $V$ is smooth.

Next, we need to show that $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is an integral curve of $V$, which means that $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}'(t) = V_{\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t)}$ for all $\mathbf{p}\in M$ and all $t\in\R$. Let $t_0\in\R$ be arbitrary, and set $\mathbf{q} = \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t_0) = \theta_{t_0}(\mathbf{p})$, so what we have to show is $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}'(t_0) = V_\mathbf{q}$. By the group law, for all $t$

$$
\begin{align*}
  \theta^{(\mathbf{q})} =& \theta_t (\mathbf{q}) = \theta_t (\theta_{t_0}(\mathbf{p})) \\
  =& \theta_{t + t_0}(\mathbf{p}) = \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t + t_0)
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, for any smooth real-valued function $f$ defined on a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{q}$

$$
\begin{align*}
  V_\mathbf{q}f =& \theta^{(q)'}(0)f = \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t=0} f(\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t)) \\
  =& \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t=0} f(\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t + t_0)) \\
  =& \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}'(t_0)f
\end{align*}

### The fundamental theorem on flows

<MathBox title='Local flow' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ is a manifold, a *flow domain* for $M$ is an open subset $D\subseteq \R\times M$ with the property that for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the set $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} = \Set{t\in\R | (t,\mathbf{p})\in D}$ is an open interval containing $0$. A (local) flow on $M$ is a continuous map $\theta:\mathcal{D}\to M$ where $\mathcal{D}\subseteq \R\times M$ is a flow domain, that satisfies the following group laws for all $\mathbf{p}\in M$: 
1. for all $s\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$ and $t\in \mathcal{D}^{(\theta(s,\mathbf{p}))}$ such that $s+t \in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$
$$
  \theta(t,\theta(s,\mathbf{p})) = \theta(t+s, \mathbf{p})
$$
2. $\theta(0,\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{p}$

If $\theta$ is a flow, we define $\theta_t (\mathbf{p}) = \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t) = \theta(t,\mathbf{p})$ whenever $(t,\mathbf{p})\in \mathcal{D}$. For each $t\in\R$, we also define

$$
  M_t = \Set{\mathbf{p}\in M | (t,\mathbf{p})\in \mathcal{D}}
$$

so that 

$$
  \mathbf{p}\in M_t \iff t\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} \iff (t,\mathbf{p})\in \mathcal{D}
$$

If $\theta$ is smooth, the *infinitesimal generator* of $\theta$ is defined by $V_\mathbf{p} = \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}'(0)$.

A *maximal flow* is a flow that admits no extension to a flow on a larger flow domain.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
If $\theta:\mathcal{D}\to M$ is a smooth flow, then the infinitesimal generator $V$ of $\theta$ is a smooth vector field, and each curve $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is an integral curve of $V$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

This proof is analogous to the proof for global flows. To show that $V$ is smooth, we need only that for any $\mathbf{p}_0 \in M$, then $\theta(t,\mathbf{p})$ is defined and smooth for all $(t,\mathbf{p})$ sufficiently close to $(0,\mathbf{p}_0)$ because $\mathcal{D}$ is open. 

To show that $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is an integral curve, assume that $t_0 \in\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$. Because both $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$ and $\mathcal{D}^{(\theta_{t_0}(\mathbf{p}))}$ are open intervals containing $0$, there is $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $t + t_0\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$ and $t\in \mathcal{D}^{(\theta_{t_0})(\mathbf{p})}$ whenever $|t| < \varepsilon$, and then $\theta_t(\theta_{t_0}(\mathbf{p})) = \theta_{t+t_0}(\mathbf{p})$ by definition of a flow. The rest of the proof goes through just as before.

<MathBox title='Fundamental theorem on flows' boxType='theorem'>
Let $V$ be a smooth vector field on a smooth manifold $M$. There is a unique smooth maximal flow $\theta: \mathcal{D}\to M$ whose infinitesimal generator is $V$. This flow has the following properties.
1. For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the curve $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}: \mathcal{D}^{(\theta)}\to M$ is the unique maximal integral curve of $V$ starting at $\mathbf{p}$.
2. If $s\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$, then $\mathcal{D}^{(\theta(s,\mathbf{p}))}$ is the interval $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} - s = \Set{t - s | t\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}}$. 
3. For each $t\in\R$, the set $M_t$ is open in $M$, and $\theta_t : M_t \to M_{-t}$ is a diffeomorphism with inverse $\theta_{-t}$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $\gamma,\tilde{\gamma}:I\subseteq\R\to M$ are two integral curves of $V$ defined on the same open interval $I$ such that $\gamma(t_0) = \tilde{\gamma}(t_0)$ for some $t_0\in J$. Define

$$
  S = \Set{t\in I | \gamma(t) = \tilde{\gamma}(t)}
$$

Clearly, $S \neq\emptyset$, because $t_0\in S$ by hypothesis, and $S$ is closed in $I$ by continuity. On the other hand, suppose that $t_1\in S$. Then in a smooth coordinate neighbourhood around the point $\mathbf{p}(t_1)$, it follows that $\gamma$ and $\tilde{\gamma}$ are both solutions to the same ODE with the same initial condition $\gamma(t_1) = \tilde{\gamma}(t_1) = \mathbf{p}$. By the uniqueness part of the fundamental theorem for ordindary differential equations, $\gamma\equiv\tilde{\gamma}$ on an interval containing $t_1$, which implies that $S$ is open in I. Since $I$ is connected, $S = I$, which implies that $\gamma = \tilde{\gamma}$ on all of $I$. Thus, any two integral curves that agree at one point agree on their common domain.

For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, let $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$ be the union of all open intervals $I\subseteq\R$ containing $0$ on which an integral curve starting at $\mathbf{p}$ is defined. Define $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}:\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}\to M$ by letting $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t) = \gamma(t)$, where $\gamma$ is any integral curve starting at $\mathbf{p}$ and defined on an open interval containing $0$ and $t$. Since all such integral curves agree at $t$ by the argument above, $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is well defined, and is obviously the unique maximal integral curve starting at $\mathbf{p}$.

Let $\mathcal{D} = \Set{(t,\mathbf{p})\in\R\times M | t\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}}$, and defined $\theta:\mathcal{D}\to M$ by $\theta(t,\mathbf{p}) = \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t)$. As usual, we also write $\theta_t(\mathbf{p}) = \theta(t,\mathbf{p})$. By definition, $\theta$ satisfies property **(a)**: for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is the unique maximal integral curve of $V$ starting at $\mathbf{p}$. To verify the group laws, fix any $\mathbf{p}\in M$ and $s\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$, and write $\mathbf{q} = \theta(s,\mathbf{p}) = \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(s)$. The curve $\gamma:\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} - s \to M$ defined by $\gamma(t) = \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t+s)$ starts at $\mathbf{q}$, and the translation lemma shows that $\gamma$ is an integral curve of $V$. By uniqueness of ODE solutions, $\gamma$ agrees with $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ on their common domain, which is equivalent to the composition group law, and the identity group law is immediate from the definition. By maximality of $\theta^{(\mathbf{q})}$, the domain of $\gamma$ cannot be larger than $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{q})}$, which mean that $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} - s \subseteq \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{q})}$. Since $0\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$, this implies that $-s\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{q})}$, and the group law implies that $\theta^{(\mathbf{q})}(-s) = \mathbf{p}$. Applying the same argument with $(-s,\mathbf{q})$ in place of $(s,\mathbf{q})$, we find that $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{q})} + s \subseteq \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$, which is the same as $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{q})} \subseteq \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} - s$. This proves **(2)**.

Next, we show that $\mathcal{D}$ is open in $\R\times M$ (so it is a flow domain), and that $\theta: \mathcal{D}\to M$ is smooth. Define a subset $W\subseteq \mathcal{D}$ as the set of all $(t,\mathbf{p})\in \mathcal{D}$ such that $\theta$ is defined and smooth on a product neighbourhood of $(t,\mathbf{p})$ of the form $I\times u\subseteq \mathcal{D}$, where $I\subseteq\R$ is open interval containing $0$ and $t$, and $U\subseteq M$ is a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$. Then $W$ is open in $\R\times M$, and the restriction of $\theta$ to $W$ is smooth, so it suffices to show that $W = \mathcal{D}$. Suppose that this is not the case. Then there exists some point $(\tau,\mathbf{p})\in \mathcal{D}\setminus W$. For simplicity, assume that $\tau > 0$; the argument for $\tau < 0$ is similar.

Let $t_0 = \inf\Set{t\in\R | (t,\mathbf{p}_0)\notin W}$. By the fundamental ODE theorem, $\theta$ is defined an smooth in som product neighbourhood of $(0,\mathbf{p}_0)$, so $t_0 > 0$. Since $t_0 \leq\tau$ and $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p}_0)}$ is an open interval containing $0$ and $\tau$, it follows that $t_0\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p}_0)}$. Let $\mathbf{q}_0 = \theta^{(\mathbf{p}_0)}(t_0)$. By the fundamental ODE theorem, there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ and a neighbourhood $U_0$ of $\mathbf{q}_0$ such that $(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)\times U_0 \subseteq W$. We will use the group law to show that $\theta$ extends smoothly to a neighbourhood of $(t_0,\mathbf{p})$, which contradicts our choice of $t_0$.

Choose some $t_1 < t_0$ such that $t_1 + \varepsilon > t_0$ and $\theta^{(\mathbf{p}_0)}(t_1) \in U_0$. Since $t_1 < t_0$, we have $(t_1,\mathbf{p}_0)\in W$, and so there is a product neighbourhood $(t_1 -\delta, t_1 + \delta)\times U_1\subseteq W$. By definition of $W$, this implies that $\theta$ is defined and smooth on $[0,t_1 + \delta)\times U_1$. Because $\theta(t_1, \mathbf{p}_0)\in U_0$, we can choose $U_1$ small enough that $\theta$ maps $\Set{t_1}\times U_1$ into $U_0$. Define $\tilde{\theta}:[0,t_1 + \varepsilon)\times U_1\to M$ by

$$
  \tilde{\theta}(t,\mathbf{p}) = \begin{cases}
    \theta_t (\mathbf{p}),\quad& \mathbf{p}\in U_1, 0\leq t < t_1,
    \theta_{t-t_1}\circ\theta_{t_1}(\mathbf{p}),\quad& \mathbf{p}\in U_1, t_1 - \varepsilon < t < t_1 + \varepsilon
  \end{cases}
$$

The group law for $\theta$ guarantees that these definitions agree where they overlap, and out choices of $U_1$, $t_1$ and $\varepsilon$ ensure that this defines a smooth map. By the translation lemma, each map $t\mapsto \tilde{\theta}(t,\mathbf{p})$ is an integral curve of $V$, so $\tilde{\theta}$ is a smooth extension of $\theta$ to a neighbourhood of $(t_0, \mathbf{p}_0)$, contradicting our choice of $t_0$. This completes the proof that $W = \mathcal{D}$.

Finally, we prove **(3)**. The fact that $M_t$ is open is an immediate consequence of the fact that $\mathcal{D}$ is open. From **(2)** we deduce

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{p}\in M_t \implies& t\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} \\
  \implies& \mathcal{D}^{(\theta_t(\mathbf{p}))} = \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} - t \\
  \implies& -t \in \mathcal{D}^{(\theta_t (\mathbf{p}))} \implies \theta_t(\mathbf{p})\in M_{-t}
\end{align*}
$$

which shows that $\theta_t$ maps $M_t$ to $M_{-t}$. Moreover, the group laws then show that $\theta_{-t}\circ \theta_{t}$ is equal to the identity on $M_t$. Reversing the roles of $t$ and $-t$ shows that $\theta_t \circ\theta_{-t}$ is the identity on $M_{-t}$, completing the proof.

<MathBox title='Naturality of flows' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds, $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map, $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ and $Y\in\mathfrak{X}(N)$. Let $\theta$ be the flow of $X$ and $\eta$ the flow of $Y$. If $X$ and $Y$ are $F$-related, then for each $t\in\R$, it follows that $F(M_t)\subseteq N_t$ and $\eta_t \circ F = F \circ\theta_t$ on $M_t$

$$
\begin{CD}
  M_t @>{F}>> N_t \\
  @V{\theta_t}VV @VV{\eta_t}V \\
  M_{-t} @>>{F}> N_{-t}
\end{CD}
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

By naturality of integral curves, for any $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the curve $F\circ\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is an integral curve of $Y$ starting at $F\circ\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(0) = F(\mathbf{p})$. By uniqueness of integral curves, therefore, the maximal integral curve $\eta^{(F(\mathbf{p}))}$ must be defined at least on the interval $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$, and $F\circ\theta^{(\mathbf{p})} = \eta^{(F(\mathbf{p}))}$ on that interval. This means that

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{p}\in M_t \implies& t\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} \implies t\in \mathcal{D}^{(F(\mathbf{p}))} \\
  \implies& F(\mathbf{p}) \in N_t
\end{align*}
$$

which is equivalent to $F(M_t) \subseteq N_t$ and

$$
  F\left(\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t) \right) = \eta^{(F(\mathbf{p}))}(t),\; \forall t\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}
$$

which is equivalent to $\eta_t \circ F(\mathbf{p}) = F\circ\theta_t(\mathbf{p})$ for all $\mathbf{p}\in M_t$.

### Complete vector fields

<MathBox title='Complete vector field' boxType='definition'>
A smooth vector field is complete if it generates a global flow, or equivalently, if each of its maximal integral curves is defined for all $t\in\R$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Uniform time lemma' boxType='lemma'>
Let $V$ be a smooth vector field on a smooth manifold $M$, and let $\theta$ be its flow. Suppose that there is $\varepsilon > 0$ such that for every $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the domain of $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ contains $(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)$. Then $V$ is complete.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose for the sake of contradiction that for some $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the domain $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$ of $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is bounded above (a similar proof works if it is bounded below). Let $b = \sup(D^{(\mathbf{p})})$, let $t_0 > 0$ such that $b - \varepsilon < t_0 < b$, and let $\mathbf{q} = \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t_0)$. The hypothesis implies that $\theta^{(\mathbf{q})}(t)$ is defined at least for $t\in(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)$. Define a curve $\gamma:(-\varepsilon, t_0 + \varepsilon) \to M$ by

$$
  \gamma(t) = \begin{cases}
    \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t),\quad& -\varepsilon < t < b
    \theta^{(\mathbf{q})}(t - t_0),\quad& t_0 - \varepsilon < t < t_0 + \varepsilon
  \end{cases}
$$

These two definitions agree where they overlap, because $\theta^{(\mathbf{q})}(t-t_0) = \theta_{t-t_0}(\mathbf{q}) = \theta_{t-t_0}\circ\theta_{t_0}(\mathbf{p}) = \theta_t(\mathbf{p}) = \theta^{(\mathbf{p})(t)}$ by the group law for $\theta$. By the translation lemma, $\gamma$ is an integral curve starting at $\mathbf{p}$. Since $t_0 + \varepsilon > b$, this is a contradiction.

<MathBox title='' boxType='theorem'>
Every compactly supported smooth vector field on a smooth manifold is complete.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $V$ is a compactly supported vector field on a smooth manifold $M$, and let $K = \mathrm{supp}(V)$. For each $\mathbf{p}\in K$, there is a neighbourhood $U_\mathbf{p}$ of $\mathbf{p}$ and a positive number $\varepsilon_\mathbf{p}$ such that the flow of $V$ is defined at least on $(-\varepsilon_\mathbf{p}, \varepsilon_\mathbf{p})\times U_\mathbf{p}$. By compactness, finitely many such sets $U_{\mathbf{p}_i},\dots,U_{\mathbf{p}_k}$ cover $K$. With $\varepsilon = \min\Set{\varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_1},\dots,\varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_k}}$, it follows that every maximal integral curve starting in $K$ is defined at least on $(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon)$. Since $V \equiv 0$ outside of $K$, every integral curve starting in $M\setminus K$ is constant and thus can be defined on all of $\R$. Thus the hypotheses of the uniform time lemma are satisfied, so $V$ is complete.

<MathBox title='' boxType='theorem'>
Every left-invariant vector field on a Lie group is complete.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $G$ be a Lie group, let $X\in\mathrm{Lie}(G)$, and let $\theta: \mathcal{D}\to G$ denote the flow of $X$. There is some $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $\theta^{(e)}$ is defined on $(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon)$.

Let $g\in G$ be arbitrary. Because $X$ is $L_g$-related to itself, it follows from naturality that the curve $L_g \circ\theta^{(e)}$ is an integral curve of $X$ starting at $g$ and therefore is equal to $\theta^{(g)}$. This shows that for each $g\in G$, the integral curve $\theta^{(g)}$ is defined at least on $(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon)$, so the uniform time lemma guarantees that $X$ is complete.

<MathBox title='Escape lemma' boxType='lemma'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold and $V\in\mathfrak{M}$. If $\gamma:I\subseteq\R\to M$ is a maximal integral curve of $V$ whose domain $I$ has a finite least upper bound $b$, the for any $t_0 \in I$, $\gamma([t_0, b))$ is not contained in any compact subset of $M$.

## Flowouts

<MathBox title='Flowout theorem' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold, $S\subseteq M$ is an embedded $k$-dimensional submanifold, and that $V\in\mathfrak{X}$ is a smooth vector field that is nowhere tangent to $S$. Let $\theta: D\to M$ be the flow of $V$, let $\mathcal{O} = (\R\times S) \cap D$ and let $\Phi = \theta|_\mathcal{O}$.

1. $\Phi: \mathcal{O}\to M$ is an immersion.
2. $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\in\mathfrak{X}(\mathcal{O})$ is $\Phi$-related to $V$.
3. There exists a smooth positive function $\delta:S\to\R$ such that the restriction of $\Phi$ to $\mathcal{O}_\delta$ is injective, where $\mathcal{O}_\delta \subseteq \mathcal{O}$ is the flow domain

$$
  \mathcal{O}_\delta = \Set{(t,\mathbf{p})\in \mathcal{O} : \lvert t \rvert < \delta(\mathbf{p})}
$$

Thus, $\Phi$ is an immersed submanifold of $M$ containing $S$, and $V$ is tangent to this submanifold. The submanifold $\Phi(\mathcal{O}_\delta) \subseteq M$ is called a *flowout* from $S$ along $V$.
4. If $S$ has codimension $1$, then $\Phi|_{\mathcal{O}_\delta}$ is a diffeomorphism onto an open submanifold of $M$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(2):** Fix $\mathbf{p}\in S$, and let $\sigma: \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}\to\R\times S$ be the curve $\sigma(t) = (t,\mathbf{p})$. Then $\Phi\circ\sigma(t) = \theta(t,\mathbf{p})$ is an integral curve of $V$, so for any $t_0\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$ it follows that

$$
  \mathrm{d}\Phi_{(t_0,\mathbf{p}_0)}\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right|_{(t_0,\mathbf{p}_0)} \right) = (\Phi\circ\sigma)'(t_0) = V_{\Phi(t_0, \mathbf{p})}
$$

**(1):** The restriction of $\Phi$ to $\Set{0}\times S$ is the composition of the diffeomorphism $\Set{0}\times S \cong S$ with the embedding $S\hookrightarrow M$, so it is an embedding. Thus, the restriction of $\mathrm{d}\Phi_{(0,\mathbf{p})}$ to $T_\mathbf{p}S$ (viewed as a subspace of $T_{(0,\mathbf{p})} \cong T_0 \R \oplus T_\mathbf{p}S$) is the inclusion $T_\mathbf{p}S \hookrightarrow T_\mathbf{p}M$. If $(E_i)_{i=1}^k$ is any basis for $T_\mathbf{p}S$, it follows that $\mathrm{d}\Phi_{(0,\mathbf{p})}$ maps the basis $\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right|_{(0,\mathbf{p})},E_1,\dots,E_k \right)$ for $T_{(0,\mathbf{p})} \mathcal{O}$ to $(V_\mathbf{p}, E_1,\dots, E_k)$. Since $V_\mathbf{p}$ is not tangent to $S$, this $(k+1)$-tuple is linearly independent and thus $\mathrm{d}\Phi_{0,\mathbf{p}}$ is injective.

To show that $\mathrm{d}\Phi$ is injective at other points, we argue as in the proof of the equivariant rank theorem. Given $(t_0, \mathbf{p}_0)\in \mathcal{O}$, let $\tau_{t_0}: \mathcal{O}\to\R\times S$ be the translation $\tau_{t_0}(t,\mathbf{p}) = (t + t_0, \mathbf{p})$. By the group law for $\theta$, the following diagram commutes (where the horizontal maps might be defined only in open subsets containing $(0, \mathbf{p}_0)$ and $\mathbf{p}_0$, respectively):

$$
\begin{CD}
  \mathcal{O} @>{\tau_0}>> \mathcal{O} \\
  @V{\Phi}VV @VV{\Phi}V \\
  M @>>{\theta_{t_0}}> M
\end{CD}
$$

Both horizontal maps in the diagram above are local diffeomorphisms. Taking differentials, we obtain

$$
\begin{CD}
  T_{(0,\mathbf{p}_0)}\mathcal{O} @>{\mathrm{d}(\tau_0)_{(0,\mathbf{p}_0)}}>> T_{(t_0,\mathbf{p}_0)}\mathcal{O} \\
  @V{\mathrm{d}\Phi_{(0,\mathbf{p}_0)}}VV @VV{\Phi_{(t_0,\mathbf{p}_0)}}V \\
  T_{\mathbf{p}_0} M @>>{\mathrm{d}(\theta_{t_0})_{\mathbf{p}_0}}> T_{\Phi_{(t_0,\mathbf{p}_0)}}M
\end{CD}
$$

Becaus the horizontal maps are isomorphisms, the two vertical maps have the same rank. Since we have already shown that $\mathrm{d}\Phi_{(0,\mathbf{p}_0)}$ has full rank, so does $\mathrm{d}\Phi_{(t_0,\mathbf{p}_0)}$. This completes the proof that $\Phi$ is an immersion.

**(3):** Given a point $\mathbf{p}_0 \in S$, choose a slice chart $(U,(x^i))$ for $S$ in $M$ centered at $\mathbf{p}_0$, so that $U\cap S$ is the set where $x^{k+1}=\dots=x^n = 0$, where $n = \dim(M)$. Because $V$ is not tangent to $S$, one of the last $n-k$ components of $V_{\mathbf{p}_0}$, say $V^j(\mathbf{p}_0)$ must be nonzero. Shrinking $U$ if necessary, we may assume that there is a constant $c > 0$ such that

$$
  \left| V^j(\mathbf{p}) \right| \geq c,\; \forall \mathbf{p}\in U
$$

Since $\Phi^{-1}(U)$ is open in $\R\times S$, we may choose a number $\varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_0} > 0$ and a neighbourhood $W_{\mathbf{p}_0}$ of $\mathbf{p}_0$ in $S$ such that $(-\varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_0}, \varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_0})\times W_{\mathbf{p}_0} \subseteq \mathcal{O}$ and $\Phi\left((-\varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_0}, \varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_0})\times W_{\mathbf{p}_0} \right) \subseteq U$. Write the component function of $\Phi$ in these local coordinates as

$$
  \Phi(t,\mathbf{p}) = (\Phi^i(t,\mathbf{p}))_{i=1}^n
$$

Because $\Phi$ is the restriction of the flow, the component function $\Phi^j$ satisfies

$$
  \frac{\partial\Phi^j}{\partial t}(t,\mathbf{p}) = V^j (\Phi(t,\mathbf{p})),\quad V^j(0,\mathbf{p}) = 0
$$

By the inequality above and the fundamental theorem of calculus, $|\Phi^j (t,\mathbf{p})|\geq c|t|$, and thus for $(t,\mathbf{p})\in (-\varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_0}, \varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_0})\times W_{\mathbf{p}_0}$ we conclude that $\Phi(t,\mathbf{p})\in S$ if and only if $t = 0$.

Choose a smooth partition of unity $\Set{\psi_\mathbf{p} | \mathbf{p}\in S}$ subordinate to the open cover $\Set{W_\mathbf{p}|\mathbf{p}\in S}$ of $S$ and define $f:S\to\R$ by

$$
  f(\mathbf{q}) = \sum_{\mathbf{p}\in S} \varepsilon_\mathbf{p}\psi_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{q})
$$

Then $f$ is smooth and positive. For each $\mathbf{q}\in S$, there are finitely many $\mathbf{p}\in S$ such that $\Psi_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{q}) > 0$. If $\mathbf{p}_0$ is one of these points such that $\varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_0}$ is maximum among all such $\varphi_\mathbf{p}$, then

$$
  f(\mathbf{q}) \leq \varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_0}\sum_{\mathbf{p}\in S}\psi_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{q}) = \varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_0}
$$

It follows that if $(t,\mathbf{q})\in \mathcal{O}$ such that $|t|< f(\mathbf{q})$, then $(t,\mathbf{q})\in(-\varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_0},\varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}_0})\times W_{\mathbf{p}_0}$, so $\Phi(t,\mathbf{q})\in S$ if and only if $t=0$.

Let $\delta = \frac{1}{2}f$. We will show that $\Phi|_{\mathcal{O}_\delta}$ is injective. Suppose that $\Phi(t,\mathbf{q}) = \Phi(t',\mathbf{q}')$ for some $(t,\mathbf{q}),(t',\mathbf{q}')\in \mathcal{O}_\delta$. By renaming the points if necessary, we may arrange that $f(\mathbf{q}')\leq f(\mathbf{q})$. Our assumption means that $\theta_t (\mathbf{q}) = \theta_{t'}(\mathbf{q}')$, and the group law for $\theta$ then implies that $\theta_{t-t'}(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{q}' \in S$. The fact that $(t,\mathbf{q})$ and $(t',\mathbf{q}')$ are in $\mathcal{O}_\delta$ implies that

$$
\begin{align*}
  |t - t'| \stackrel{\triangle}{\leq}& |t| + |t'| \\
  <& \frac{1}{2}f(\mathbf{q}) + \frac{1}{2}f(\mathbf{q}') \leq f(\mathbf{q})
\end{align*}
$$

which forces $t = t'$ and $\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{q}'$.

**(4):** If $S$ has codimension $1$, then $\Phi|_{\mathcal{O}_\delta}$ is an injective smooth immersion between manifolds of the same dimension, so it is an embedding and a diffeomorphism onto an open submanifold.

### Regular and singular points

<MathBox title='Regular and singular point' boxType='definition'>
If $V$ is a vector field on a smooth manifold $M$, a point $\mathbf{p}\in M$ is a *singular point* of $V$ if $V_\mathbf{p} = 0$ and a regular point otherwise.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Equilibrium point' boxType='definition'>
If $\theta:\mathcal{D}\to M$ is flow on a smooth manifold $M$, a point $\mathbf{p}\in M$ is called an *equilibrium point* of $\theta$ if $\theta(t,\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{p}$ for all $t\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$.
</MathBox>

The following proposition shows that the equilibrium points of a smooth flow are precisely the singular points of its infinitesimal generator.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $V$ be a smooth vector field on a smooth manifold $M$, and let $\theta:\mathcal{D}\to M$ be the flow generated by $V$. If $\mathbf{p}\in M$ is a singular point of $V$, then $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} = \R$ and $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is the constant curve $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t) \equiv \mathbf{p}$. If $\mathbf{p}$ is a regular point, then $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}: \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} \to M$ is a smooth immersion.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $V_\mathbf{p} = 0$, then the constant curve $\gamma:\R\to M$ given by $\gamma(t)\equiv\mathbf{p}$ is clearly an integral curve of $V$, so by uniqueness and maximality it must be equal to $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$.

To verify the second statement, we proce its contrapositive: if $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is not an immersion then $\mathbf{p}$ is a singular point. The assumption that $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is not an immersion means that $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}'(s) = 0$ for some $s\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$. Write $\mathbf{q} = \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(s)$. Then the preceding argument implies that $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{q})} = \R$ and $\theta^{(\mathbf{q})}(t) = \mathbf{q}$ for all $t\in\R$. If follows from the fundamental theorem on flows that $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} = \R$ as well, and for all $t\in\R$ the group law gives

$$
\begin{align*}
  \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t) =& \theta_t(\mathbf{p}) = \theta_{t-s}(\theta_s(\mathbf{p})) \\
  =& \theta_{t-s}(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{q}
\end{align*}
$$

Setting $t=0$ yields $\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{q}$, and thus $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t) \equiv\mathbf{p}$ and $V_\mathbf{p} = \theta^{(\mathbf{p})}'(0) = 0$.

<MathBox title='Canonical form near a regular point' boxType='theorem'>
Let $V$ be a smooth vector field on a smooth manifold $M$, and let $\mathbf{p}\in M$ be a regular point of $V$. There exist smooth coordinates $(s^i)$ on some neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ in which $V$ has the coordinate representation $\frac{\partial}{\partial s^1}$. If $S\subseteq M$ is any embedded hypersurface with $\mathbf{p}\in S$ and $V_\mathbf{p}\in T_\mathbf{p} S$, then the coordinates can also be chosen so that $s^1$ is alocal defining function for $S$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If no hypersurface $S$ is given, choose any smooth coordinates $(U, (x^))$ centered at $p$, and let $S\subseteq U$ be the hypersurface defined by $x^j = 0$, where $j$ is chosen so that $V^j(\mathbf{p}) \neq 0$.

Regardless of whether $S$ was given or was constructed as above, since $V_\mathbf{p} \notin T_\mathbf{p}S$, we can shrink $S$ if necessary so that $V$ is nowhere tangent to $S$. The flowout theorem then says that there is a flow domain $O_\delta \subseteq \R\times S$ such that the flow of $V$ restricts to a diffeomorphism $\Phi$ from $O_\delta$ onto an open subset $W\subseteq M$ containing $S$. There is a product neighbourhood $(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)\times W_0$ of $(0,\mathbf{p})$ in $O_\delta$. Choose a smooth local parametrization $X:\Omega\to S$ whose image is contained in $W_0$, where $\Omega$ is ano open subset of $\R^{n-1}$ with coordinates denoted by $(s^2,\dots,s^n)$. If follows that the map $\Psi:(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon)\times\Omega\to M$ given by

$$
  \Psi(t,s^2,\dots,s^n) = \Phi(t, X(s^2,\dots,s^n))
$$

is a diffeomorphism onto a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}\in M$. Because the diffeomorphism $(t,s^1,\dots,s^2)\mapsto (t,X(s^2,\dots,s^n))$ pushes $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ forward to itself and $\Phi_*\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right) = V$, it follows that $\Psi_*\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \right) = V$. Thus $\Psi^{-1}$ is a smooth coordinate chart in which $V$ has the coordinate representation $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$. Renaming $t$ to $s^1$ completes the proof.

## Flows and flowouts on manifolds with boundary

<MathBox title='Boundary flowout theorem' boxType='theorem'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with nonempty boundary, and let $N$ be a smooth vector field on $M$ that is inward-pointing at each point of $\partial M$. There exist a smooth function $\delta: \partial M\to\R^+$ and a smooth embedding $\Phi: \mathcal{P}_\delta \to M$ where $\mathcal{P}_\delta = \Set{(t,\mathbf{p}) | \mathbf{p}\in\partial M, 0\leq t < \delta(\mathbf{p})} \subseteq \R\times\delta M$ such that $\Phi(\mathcal{P}_\delta)$ is a neighbourhood of $\partial M$, and for each $\mathbf{p}\in\partial M$ the map $t\mapsto \Phi(t,\mathbf{p})$ is an integral curve of $N$ starting at $\mathbf{p}$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Collar neighbourhood' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with boundary. A neighbourhood of $\partial M$ is called a *collar neighbourhood* if it is the image of a smooth embedding $[0,1)\times\partial M \to M$ that restricts to the obvious idenitfication $\Set{0}\times\partial M\to\partial M$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Collar neighbourhood theorem' boxType='theorem'>
If $M$ be a smooth manifold with nonempty boundary, then $\partial M$ has a collar neighbourhood.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

There exists a smooth vector field $N\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ whose restriction to $\partial M$ is everywhere inward-pointing. Let $\delta:M\to \R^+$ and $\Phi:P_\delta \to M$ be as in the boundary flowout theorem, and define a map $\psi:[0,1)\times\partial M \to P_\delta$ by $\psi(t,\mathbf{p}) = (t\delta(\mathbf{p}), \mathbf{p})$. Then $\psi$ is a diffeomorphism that restricts to the identity on $\Set{0}\times\partial M$, and therefore the map $\Phi\circ\psi: [0,1)\times\partial M \to M$ is a smooth embedding with open image that restricts to the usual idenitfication $\Set{0}\times\partial M\to\partial M$. The image of $\Phi\circ\psi$ is a collar neighbourhood of $\partial M$.

<MathBox title='Smooth manifolds with boundary are homotopy equivalent to their interior' boxType='theorem'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with nonempty boundary, and let $\iota: \mathrm{int}(M)\to M$ denote inclusion. There exists a proper smooth embedding $R:M\to\mathrm{int}(M)$ such that both $\iota\circ R: M\to M$ and $R\circ\iota: \mathrm{int}(M) \to \mathrm{int}(M)$ are smoothly homotopic to identity maps. Therefore, $\iota$ is a homotopy equivalence.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The collar neighbourhood theorem shows that $\partial M$ has a collar neighbourhood $C$ in $M$, which is the image of a smooth embedding $E:[0,1)\times\partial M \to M$ satisfying $E(0,\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}$ for all $\mathbf{x}\in\partial M$. To simplify the notation, we will use this embedding to idenfity $C$ with $[0,1)\times\partial M$, and denote a point in $C$ as an ordered pair $(s,\mathbf{x})$ with $s\in [0,1)$ and $\mathbf{x}\in\partial M$. Thus, $(s,\mathbf{x})\in\partial M$ if and only if $s = 0$. For any $a \in (0,1)$ let $C(a) = \Set{(s,\mathbf{x})\in C | 0\leq s < a}$ and $M(a) = M\setminus C(a)$, which is a regular domain in $\mathrm{int}(M)$. Let $\psi:[0,1) \to [\frac{1}{3},1)$ be an increasing diffeomorphism that satisfies $\psi(s) = s$ for $\frac{2}{3}\leq s < 1$, and defined $R:M\to\mathrm{int}(M)$ by

$$
  R(\mathbf{p}) = \begin{cases}
    \mathbf{p},\quad& \mathbf{p}\in \mathrm{int}(M(2/3)) \\
    (\psi(s),\mathbf{x}), \quad& \mathbf{p} = (s,\mathbf{x})\in C
  \end{cases}
$$

These definitions both give the identity map on the set $C\setminus C(2/3)$ where they overlap, so $R$ is smooth by the gluing lemma. It is a diffeomorphism onto the closed subset $M(1/3)$, so it is a proper smooth embedding of $M$ into $\mathrm{int}(M)$.

Define $H:M\times I \to M$ bY

$$
  H(\mathbf{p},t) = \begin{cases}
    \mathbf{p},\quad& \mathbf{p}\in\mathrm{int}(M(2/3)) \\
    (ts + (1 - t)\psi(s), \mathbf{x}),\quad \mathbf{p} = (s,\mathbf{x})\in C
  \end{cases}
$$

As before, $H$ is smooth, and a straightforward verification shows that it is a homotopy from $\iota\circ R$ to $\mathrm{id}_M$. If $\mathbf{p}\in\mathrm{int}(M)$ then $H(\mathbf{p},t)\in\mathrm{int}(M)$ for all $t\in I$, so the restriction of $H$ to $\mathrm{int}(M) \times I$ is smooth homotopy from $R\circ\iota$ to $\mathrm{id}_{\mathrm{int}(M)}$.

<MathBox title='Whitney approximation for manifolds with boundary' boxType='theorem'>
If $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with boundary, then every continuous map from $M$ to $N$ is homotopic to a smooth map.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The Whitney approximation theorem takes care of the case $\partial N = \emptyset$, so we may assume that $\partial N \neq \emptyset$. Let $F:M\to N$ be a continuous map, let $\iota: \mathrm{int}(N)\hookrightarrow N$ be inclusion, and let $R:N\to \mathrm{int}(N)$ be map constructed in the homotopy equivalence theorem, so that $\iota\circ R: N\to N$ is smooth homotopic to $\mathrm{id}_N$. The Whitney approximation theorem shows that $R\circ F: M\to\mathrm{int}(N)$ is homotopic to a smooth map $G$. It follows that $\iota\circ G \simeq \iota R\circ F \simeq F$ so $\iota\circ G:M\to N$ is a smooth map homotopic to $F$.

Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary. If $F,G:M\to N$ are homotopic smooth maps, then they are smoothly homotopic.

The Whitney approximation theorem takes care of the case $\partial N = \emptyset$, so we may assume that $\partial N \neq \emptyset$. Let $\iota: \mathrm{int}(N)\hookrightarrow N$ and $R:N\to\mathrm{int}(N)$ be as in the homotopy equivalence theorem. Then $R\circ F$ and $R\circ G$ are homotopic smooth maps from $M$ to $\mathrm{int}(N)$, so the Whitney approximation theorem shows that they are smoothly homotopic to each other. Thus, we have smooth homotopies $F\simeq\iota\circ R\circ F\simeq\iota \circ R\circ G \simeq G$. By transitivity of smooth homotopy, it follows that $F$ is smoothly homotopic to $G$.

<MathBox title='Attaching smooth manifolds along their boundaries' boxType='theorem'>
Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth $n$-manifolds with nonempty boundaries, and suppose that $h:\partial N \to \partial M$ is a diffeomorphism. Let $M \cup_h N$ be the adjunction space formed by identifying each $\mathbf{x}\in\partial N$ with $h(\mathbf{x})\in\partial M$. Then $M\cup_h N$ is a topological manifold (without boundary), and has a smooth structure such that there are regular domains $M', N'\subseteq M\cup_h N$ diffeomorphic to $M$ and $N$, respectively, and satisfying

$$
\begin{align*}
  M' \cup N' =& M \cup_h N \\
  M' \cap N' =& \partial M' = \partial N
\end{align*}
$$

If $M$ and $N$ are both compact, then $M \cup_h N$ is compact, and if they are both connected, then $M \cup_h N$ is connected.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

For simplicity, let $X = M \cup_h N$ denote the quotient space and $\pi: M \sqcup N \to S$ the quotient map. Let $V \subseteq M$ and $W \subseteq N$ be collar neighbourhoods of $\partial M$ and $\partial N$, respectively, and denote the corresponding diffeomorphisms by $\alpha: [0,1) \times\partial M \to V$ and $\beta: [0,1)\times\partial N\to W$. Define a continuous map $\Phi: V\sqcup M \to (-1,1)\times \partial M$ by

$$
  \Phi(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{cases}
    (-t,\mathbf{p}),\quad& \mathbf{x} = \alpha(t,\mathbf{p})\in V \\
    (t,h(\mathbf{q})),\quad& \mathbf{x} = \beta(t,\mathbf{q})\in W
  \end{cases}
$$

Then the restriction of $\Phi$ to $V$ or $W$ is a topological embedding with closed image, from which it follows easily that $\Phi$ is a closed map. Because $\Phi$ is constant on the fibers of $\pi$, it descends to a continuous map $\tilde{\Phi}:\pi(V\sqcup W) \to (-1,1)\times\partial M$. This map is bijective, and it is a homeomorphism because it too is a closed map: if $K\subseteq \pi(V\sqcup W)$ is closed, then $\pi^{-1}(K)$ is closed in $V\sqcup W$, and therefore $\tilde{\Phi}(K) = \Phi(\pi^{-1}(K))$ is closed. Thus, $\pi(V\sqcup W)$ is a topological $n$-manifold. On the other hand, the restriction of $\pi$ to the saturated open subset $\mathrm{int}(M) \sqcup \mathrm{int}(N)$ is an injective quotient map and this a homeomorphism onto its image; this shows that $X$ is locally Eucliedean of dimension $n$. Since $X$ is the union of the second-countable open subsets $\pi(\mathrm{int}(M)\sqcup\mathrm{int}(N))$ and $\pi(V\sqcup W)$, it is second-countable. Any two fibers in $M\sqcup N$ can be separated by saturated open subsets, so $X$ is Hausdorff. Thus, it is a topological manifold.

We define a collection of charts on $X$ as follows:
- $(\pi(U), \varphi\circ\pi^{-1}|_{\pi(U)})\$, for each smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $\mathrm{int}(M)$ or $\mathrm{int}(N)$
- $(\tilde{\Phi}^{-1}(U), \varphi\circ\tilde{\Phi}|_{\tilde{\Phi}^{-1}(U)})$, for each smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $(-1,1)\times\partial M$

These maps are compositions of homeomorphisms, so they define coordinate charts on $X$, and it is straightforward to check that they are smoothly compatible and thus define a smooth structure on $X$. The restriction of $\pi$ to $M$ is continuous, closed, and injective, and thus it is a proper embedding. In terms of any of the smooth charts constructed above and corresponding charts on $M$, $\pi$ has a coordinate representation that is either an identity map or an inclusion map, so it is a smooth embedding, and its image $M'$ is therefore a regular domain in $X$. Similar considerations apply to $N$, and the statement conditions follow immediately from the definitions.

If $M$ and $N$ are compact, then $X$ is the union of the compact sets $M'$ and $N'$, so it is compact; if they are connected, then $X$ is the union of the connected sets $M'$ and $N'$ with points of $\partial M' = \partial N'$ in common, so it is connected.

<MathBox title='The double of a smooth manifold with boundary' boxType='example'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with boundary. The *double* of $M$ is the manifold $D(M) = M \cup_{\mathrm{id}} M$, where $\mathrm{id}:\partial M\to \partial M$ is the identity map of $\partial M$. It is obtained from $M\sqcup M$ by identifying each boundary point in one copy of $M$ with the same boundary point in the other. It is a smooth manifold without boundary, and contains two regular domains diffeomorphic to $M$. It is easy to check that $D(M)$ is compact if and only if $M$ is compact, and connected if and only if $M$ is connected.

Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold and that $\mathcal{D}\subseteq M$ is a regular domain. If $V$ is a smooth vector field on $M$ that is tangent to $\partial \mathcal{D}$, then every integral curve of $V$ that starts in $\mathcal{D}$ remains in $\mathcal{D}$ as long as it is defined.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $\gamma:I\to M$ is an integral curve of $V$ with $\gamma(0)\in \mathcal{D}$. Define $T\subseteq I$ by $T = \Set{t\in I | \gamma(t) \in \mathcal{D}}$. We will show that $T$ is both open and closed in $I$. Since $I$ is an interval, this implies $T = I$ and proves the lemma.

Since $\mathcal{D}$ is closed in $M$ (by definition of a regular domain), $T$ is closed in $I$ by continuity. To prove it is open, suppose $t_0 \in T$. If $\gamma(t_0) \in \mathrm{int}(\mathcal{D})$, then a neighbourhood of $t_0$ is contained in $T$ by continuity, so we can assume that $\gamma(t_0)\in\partial \mathcal{D}$. Because $V$ is tangent to $\partial \mathcal{D}$, there is a smooth vector field $W = V|_{\partial \mathcal{D}}$ that is $\iota$-related to $V$, where $\iota: \partial \mathcal{D} \hookrightarrow M$ is inclusion. Let $\tilde{\gamma}:(t_0 - \varepsilon, t_0 + \varepsilon) \to \partial \mathcal{D}$ be an integral curve of $W$ with $\tilde{\gamma}(t_0) = \gamma(t_0)$. By naturality of integral curves, $\iota\circ\tilde{\gamma}$ is an integral curve of $V$ with the same initial condition, so by uniqueness it must be equal to $\gamma$ where both are defined. This shows that $\gamma(t) \in\partial \mathcal{D}\subseteq \mathcal{D}$ for $t$ in some neighbourhood of $t_0$, so $T$ is open in $I$ as claimed.

1. For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the curve $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}: \mathcal{D}^{(\theta)}\to M$ is the unique maximal integral curve of $V$ starting at $\mathbf{p}$.
2. If $s\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$, then $\mathcal{D}^{(\theta(s,\mathbf{p}))}$ is the interval $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} - s = \Set{t - s | t\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}}$. 
3. For each $t\in\R$, the set $M_t$ is open in $M$, and $\theta_t : M_t \to M_{-t}$ is a diffeomorphism with inverse $\theta_{-t}$.

<details>

We can consider $M$ as a regular domain in its double $D(M)$. By the extension lemma for vector fields, we can extend $V$ to a smooth vector field $\tilde{V}$ on $D(M)$. Let $\tilde{\theta}:\tilde{\mathcal{D}}\to D(M)$ be the flow of $\tilde{V}$, and let $\mathcal{D} = \tilde{\mathcal{D}}\cap (\R\times M)$ and $\theta = \tilde{\theta}|_\mathcal{D}$. Then the previous lemma guarantees that $\theta$ maps $\mathcal{D}$ into $M$, and the rest of the conclusions follow from the fundamental theorem on flows applied to $\tilde{V}$.

$$
\begin{align*}

  =& \lim_{t\to 0} \frac{\mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}(W_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}) - W_\mathbf{p}}{t}
\end{align*}
$$

provided that the derivative exists. 

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

For small $t\neq 0$, the difference quotient makes sense: $\theta_t$ is defined in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ and $\theta_{-t}$ is the inverse of $\theta_t$, so both $\mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}(W_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})})$ and $W_\mathbf{p}$ are elements of $T_\mathbf{p}M$.

If $M$ has nonempty boundary, this definition of $\mathcal{L}_V W$ makes sense as long as $V$ is tangent to $\partial M$ so that its flow exists by the flow theorem for maniolds with boundary.

<MathBox title='' boxType='lemma'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and that $V,W\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ are smooth vector fields on $M$. If $\partial M \neq\emptyset$, assume in addition that $V$ is tangent to $\partial M$. Then $(\mathcal{L}_V W)_\mathbf{p}$ exists for every $\mathbf{p}\in M$, and $\mathcal{L}_V W$ is a smooth vector field.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\theta$ be the flow of $V$. For arbitrary $\mathbf{p}\in M$, let $(U, (x^i))$ be a smooth chart containing $\mathbf{p}$. Choose an open interval $J_0\subseteq \R$ containing $0$ and an open subset $U_0 \subseteq U$ containing $\mathbf{p}$ such that $\theta$ maps $J_0 \times U_0$ into $U$. For $(t,\mathbf{x})\in J_0 \times U_0$, write the component functions of $\theta$ as $(\theta^i(t,\mathbf{x}))_{i=1}^n$. Then for any $(t,\mathbf{x})\in J_0 \times U_0$ the matrix of $\mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t (\mathbf{x})}: T_{\theta_t(\mathbf{x})} M \to T_\mathbf{x} M$ is

$$
  \left(\frac{\partial\theta^i}{\partial x^j}(-t, \theta(t, \mathbf{x})) \right)
$$

Therefore

$$
  \mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t(\mathbf{x})}(W_{\theta_t (\mathbf{x})}) = \frac{\partial\theta^i}{\partial x^j}(-t, \theta(t,\mathbf{x}))W^j(\theta(t, \mathbf{x})) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{x}
$$

Because $\theta^i$ and $W^j$ are smooth functions, the coefficient of $\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{x}$ depends smoothly on $(t,\mathbf{x})$. It follows that $(\mathcal{L}_V W)_\mathbf{x}$, which is obtained by taking the derivative of this expression with respect to $t$ and setting $t = 0$, exists for each $\mathbf{x}\in U_0$ and depends smoothly on $\mathbf{x}$.

<MathBox title='Lie derivative is equal to Lie bracket' boxType='theorem'>
If $M$ is a smooth manifold and $V, W\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$, then $\mathcal{L}_V W = [V,W]$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Assume that $n = \dim(M)$. Suppose that $V,W\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$, and let $R(V) \subseteq M$ be the set of regular points of $V$, i.e. the set of points $\mathbf{p}\in M$ such that $V_\mathbf{p} \neq 0$. Note that $R(V)$ is open in $M$ by continuity, and its close is the support of $V$. We will show that $(\mathcal{L}_V W)_\mathbf{p} = [V, W]_\mathbf{p}$ for all $\mathbf{p}\in M$, by considering three cases.

**Case 1: $\mathbf{p}\in R(V)$**<br/>
In this case, we can choose smooth coordinates $(u^i)$ on a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ in which $V$ has the coordinate representation $V = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}$. In these coordinates, the flow of $V$ is $\theta_t (\mathbf{u}) = (u^1 + t, u^2,\dots, u^n)$. For each fixed $t$, the matrix of $\mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t (\mathbf{x})}$ in these coordinates is the identity at every point. Consequently, for any $\mathbf{u}\in U$

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t(\mathbf{u})}(W_{\theta_t (\mathbf{u})}) =& \mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t(\mathbf{x})}\left( W^j (u^1 + t,u^2,\dots,u^n) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial u^j}\right|_{\theta_t (\mathbf{u})} \right) \\
  =& W^j (u^1 + t, u^2,\dots,u^n)\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial u^j}\right|_\mathbf{u}
\end{align*}
$$

Using the definition of the Lie derivative we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
  (\mathcal{L}_V W) =& \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t=0} W^j (u^1 + t, u^2,\dots,u^n)\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial u^j}\right|_\mathbf{u} \\
  =& \frac{\partial W^j}{\partial u^1}(u^1,\dots,u^n)\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial u^j}\right|_\mathbf{u}
\end{align*}
$$

On the other hand, $[V,W]_\mathbf{u}$ is easily seen to be equal to the same expression by the Lie bracket formula.

**Case 2: $\mathbf{p}\in\mathrm{supp}(V)$**<br/>
Because $\mathrm{supp}(V)$ is the closure of $R(V)$, it follows by continuity from case 1 that $(\mathcal{L}_V W)_\mathbf{p} = [V,W]_\mathbf{p}$ for $\mathbf{p}\in\mathrm{supp}(V)$.

**Case 3: $\mathbf{p}\in M\setminus\mathrm{supp}(V)$**<br/>
In this case, $V \equiv 0$ on a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$. On the one hand, this implies that $\theta_t$ is equal to the identity map in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ for all $t$, so $\mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}(W_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}) = W_\mathbf{p}$, which implies that $(\mathcal{L}_V W)_\mathbf{p} = 0$. On the other hand $[V, W]_\mathbf{p} = 0$.

Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and $V, W \in\mathfrak{X}(M)$. If $\partial M \neq\emptyset$, assume also that $V$ is tangent to $\partial M$. Let $\theta$ be the flow of $V$. For any $(t_0,\mathbf{p})$ in the domain of $\theta$,

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\mathbf{p}\in M$ be arbitrary, let $\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}\subseteq\R$ denote the domain of the integral curve $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$, and consider the map $X:\mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})} \to T_\mathbf{p}M$ given by $X(t) = \mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}(W_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})})$. The argument in the proof of the previous lemma shows that $X$ is a smooth curve in the vector space $T_\mathbf{p}M$. Making the change of variables $t = t_0 + s$ we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
  X'(t_0) =& \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\right|_{s=0} X(t_0 + s) \\
  =& \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\right|_{s=0} \mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t_0 - s})(W_{\theta_{s + t_0}(\mathbf{p})}) \\
  =& \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\right|_{s=0} \mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})\circ\mathrm{d}(\theta_{-s})(W_{\theta_s(\theta_{t_0}(\mathbf{p}))}) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t_0})\left( \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\right|_{s=0} \mathrm{d}(\theta_{-s})(W_{\theta_s(\theta_{t_0}(\mathbf{p}))}) \right)
\end{align*}
$$

The last equality follows because $\mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t_0}): T_{\theta_{t_0}(\mathbf{p})} M \to T_\mathbf{p}M$ is a linear map that is independent of $s$. By definition of the Lie derivative, this last expression is equal to the right-hand side of statement equation.

## Commuting vector fields

If $\theta$ is a smooth flow, a vector field $W$ is *invariant* under $\theta$ if $W$ is $\theta_t$-related to itself for each $t$. This mean that $W|_{M_t}$ is $\theta_t$-related to $W|_{M_{-t}}$ for each $t$, or equivalently that $\mathrm{d}(\theta_t)_\mathbf{p}(W_\mathbf{p}) = W_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}$ for all $(t,\mathbf{p})$ in the domain of $\theta$.

1. $V$ and $W$ commute
2. $W$ is invariant under the flow of $V$
3. $V$ is invariant under the flow of $W$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $V,W\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$, and let $\theta$ denote the flow of $V$. If **(2)** holds, then $W_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})} = \mathrm{d}(\theta_t)_\mathbf{p}(W_\mathbf{p})$ whenever $(t,\mathbf{p})$ is in the domain of $\theta$. Applying $\mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}$ to both sides, we conclude that $\mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}(W_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}) = W_\mathbf{p}$, which obviously implies $[V,W] = \mathcal{L}_V W = 0$ directly from the definition of the Lie derivative. The same argument shows that **(3)** implies **(1)**.

To prove that **(1)** implies **(2)**, assume that $[V,W] = \mathcal{L}_V W = 0$. Let $\mathbf{p}\in M$ be arbitrary, and let $X(t) = \mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}(W_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})})$ for $t\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$. The previous proposition shows that $X'(t) \equiv 0$. Since $X(0) = W_\mathbf{p}$, this implies that $X(t) = W_\mathbf{p}$ for all $t\in \mathcal{D}^{(\mathbf{p})}$, and applying $\mathrm{d}(\theta_t)_\mathbf{p}$ to both sides yields the identity that says $W$ is invariant under $\theta$. The same proof also shows that **(1)** implies **(2)**.

<MathBox title='' boxType='theorem'>
Smooth vector fields commute if and only if their flows commute.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $V$ and $W$ be smooth vector fields on a smooth manifold $M$, and let $\theta$ and $\psi$ denote their respective flows. Assume first that $V$ and $W$ commute. Suppose that $\mathbf{p}\in M$, and that $J$ and $K$ are open intervals containing $0$ such that $\psi_s \circ\theta_t (\mathbf{p})$ is defined for all $(s,t)\in J\times K$. (The same proof with $V$ and $W$ reversed works under the assumption that the other expression is defined on such a rectangle.) By equivalence of commutation and invariance, the hypothesis implies that $V$ is invariant under $\psi$. Fix any $s\in J$, and consider the curve $\gamma: K\to M$ defined by $\gamma(t) = \psi_s \circ\theta_t (\mathbf{p}) = \psi_s (\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t))$. This curves satisfies $\gamma(0) = \psi(\mathbf{p})$, and its velocity at $t\in K$ is

$$
\begin{align*}
  \gamma'(t) =& \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}}(\psi_s (\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t))) = \mathrm{d}(\psi_s)(\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}'(t)) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(\psi_s)(V_{\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t)}) = V_{\gamma(t)}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, $\gamma$ is an integral curve of $V$ starting at $\psi_s(\mathbf{p})$. By uniqueness, it follows that

$$
  \gamma(t) = \theta^{\psi_s(\mathbf{p})}(t) = \theta_t (\psi_s (\mathbf{p}))
$$

showing that $\theta$ and $\psi$ commute.

Converesely, assume that the flows commute, and let $\mathbf{p}\in M$. If $\varepsilon > 0$ is chosen small enough that $\psi_s \circ\theta_t (\mathbf{p})$ is defined whenever $|s| < \varepsilon$ and $|t| < \varepsilon$, the the hypothesis guarantees that $\psi_s \circ\theta_t(\mathbf{p}) = \theta_t \circ\psi_s (\mathbf{p})$ for all such $s$ and $t$. This can be rewritten in the form

$$
  \psi^{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}(s) = \theta_t(\psi^{(\mathbf{p})}(s))
$$

Differentiating this relation with respect to $s$, we get

$$
\begin{align*}
  W_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})} =& \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathbf{d}s}\right|_{s=0} \psi^{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}(s) \\
  =& \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\right|_{s=0}\theta_t (\psi^{(\mathbf{p})}(s)) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(\theta_t)_\mathbf{p}(W_\mathbf{p})
\end{align*}
$$

Applying $\mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}$ to both sides, we conclude that

$$
  \mathrm{d}(\theta_{-t})_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}(W_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}) = W_\mathbf{p}
$$

Differentiating with respect to $t$ and applying the definition of the Lie derivative shows that $(\mathcal{L}_V W)_\mathbf{p} = 0$.

<MathBox title='Canonical form for commuting vector fields' boxType='theorem'>
Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold, and let $(V_i)_{i=1}^k$ be a linearly independent $k$-tuple of smooth commuting vector fields on an open subset $W\subseteq M$. For each $\mathbf{p}\in W$, there exists a smooth coordinate chart $(U, (s^i))$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$ such that $V_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial s^i}$ for $i = 1,\dots,k$. If $S\subseteq W$ is an embedded codimension-$k$ submanifold and $\mathbf{p}$ is a point of $S$ such that $T_\mathbf{p}S$ is complementary to the span of $(V_i|_\mathbf{p})_{i=1}^k$, then the coordinates can also be chosen such that $S\cap U$ is the slice defined by $s^1 =\cdots=s^k = 0$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\mathbf{p}\in W$ be arbitrary. If no submanifold $S$ is given, just let $S$ be any smooth embedded codimension-$k$ submanifold $S$ whose tangent space at $\mathbf{p}$ is complementary to the span of $(V_i|_\mathbf{p})_{i=1}^k$. Let $(U,(x^i))$ be a slice chart for $S$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$, with $U\subseteq W$, and with $S\cap U$ equal to the slice $\Set{\mathbf{x}\in U | x^1 =\cdots=x^k = 0}$. 

Our assumptions ensure that the vectors $\Set{V_1|_\mathbf{p},\dots,V_k|_\mathbf{p},\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{k+1}}\right|_\mathbf{p},\dots,\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\right|_\mathbf{p}}$ span $T_\mathbf{p} M$. Since the theorem is purely local, we may as well consider $V_i$ as vector fields on $U\subseteq\R^n$, and consider $S$ to be the subset of $U$ where the first $k$ coordinates vanish. The basic idea of this proof is similar to that of the flowout theorem, except that we have to do a bit of extra work to make use of the hypothesis that the vector fields commute.

Let $\theta_i$ denote the flow of $V_i$ for $i=1,\dots,k$. There exist $\varepsilon > 0$ and a neighbourhood $Y$ of $\mathbf{p}$ in $U$ such that the composition $(\theta_1)_{t_1} \circ (\theta_2)_{t_2}\circ\dots\circ(\theta_k)_{t_k}$ is defined on $Y$ and maps $Y$ into $U$ whenever $|t_1|,\dots,|t_k|$ are all less than $\varepsilon$. (To see this, just choose $\varepsilon_k > 0$ and $U_k \subseteq U$ such that $\theta_k$ maps $(-\varepsilon_k,\varepsilon_k)\times U_k$ into U and then inductively choose $\varepsilon_i$ and $U_i$ such that $\theta_i$ maps $(-\varepsilon_i, \varepsilon_i)\times U_i$ into $U_{i+1}$. Taking $\varepsilon = \min\Set{\varepsilon_i}$ and $Y = U$ does the trick.)

Define $\Omega\subseteq\R^{n-k}$ by

$$
  \Omega = \Set{(s^{k+1},\dots,s^n)\in\R^{n-k} | (0,\dots,0,s^{k+1},\dots,s^n)\in Y}
$$

and define $\Phi:(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)^k \times\Omega\to U$ bY

$$
\begin{align*}
  &\Phi(s^1,\dots,s^k,s^{k+1},\dots,s^n) \\
  =& (\theta_1)_{s^1} \circ\cdots\circ (\theta_k)_{s^k}(0,\dots,0,s^{k+1},\dots,s^n)
\end{align*}
$$

By construction, $\Phi(\Set{0}\times\Omega) = S\cap Y$.

We show next that $\frac{\partial}{\partial s^i}$ is $\varphi$-related to $V_i$ for $i=1,\dots,k$. Because the flows $\theta_i$ commute, for any $i\in\Set{1,\dots,k}$ and any $s_0\in(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)^k \times\Omega$ we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}\Phi_{s_0}\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial s^i}\right|_{s_0}\right) =& \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial s^i}\right|_{s_0} f(\Phi(s^1,\dots,s^n)) \\
  =& \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial s^i}\right|_{s_0} f\left((\theta_1)_{s^1} \circ\cdots\circ (\theta_k)_{s^k} (0,\dots,0,s^{k+1},\dots,s^n) \right) \\
  =& \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial s^i}\right|_{s_0} f\left((\theta_i)_{s_i} \circ (\theta_1)_{s^1} \circ\cdots\circ (\theta_{i-1})_{s^{i-1}} \circ (\theta_{i+1})_{s^{i+1}} \right. \\
  &\left.\circ\cdots\circ (\theta_k)_{s^k} (0,\dots,0,s^{k+1},\dots,s^n)\right)
\end{align*}
$$

For any $q\in M$, then $t\mapsto (\theta_i)(\mathbf{q})$ is an integral curve of $V_i$, so this last expression is equal to $V_i|_{\Phi(s_0)}f$, which proves the claim.

Next, we show that $\mathrm{d}\Phi_0$ is invertible. The computation above shows that

$$
  \mathrm{d}\Phi_0 \left( \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial s^i}\right|_0 \right) = V_i|_\mathbf{p},\; i=1,\dots,k
$$

On the other hand, since $\Phi(0,\dots,0,s^{k+1},\dots,s^n) = (0,\dots,0,s^{k+1},\dots,s^n)$, it follows immediately that

$$
  \mathrm{d}\Phi_0 \left( \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial s^i}\right|_0 \right) = \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p},\; i=k+1,\dots,n
$$

It follows that $\mathrm{d}\Phi_0$ takes the basis $\left( \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial s^i}\right|_0 \right)_{i=1}^n$ for $T_\mathbf{0}\R^n$ to the basis $\left(V_1|_\mathbf{p},\dots, V_k|_\mathbf{p}, \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial^{k+1}}\right|_\mathbf{p},\dots,\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial^n}\right|_\mathbf{p}, \right)$ for $T_\mathbf{p}M$. By the inverse function theorem, $\Phi$ is a diffeomorphism in a neighbourhood of $0$, and $\varphi = \Phi^{-1}$ is a smooth coordinate map that takes $\frac{\partial}{\partial s^i}$ to $V_i$ for $i=1,\dots,k$, and takes $S$ to the slice $s^1 =\cdots= s^k = 0$.

## Time-dependent vector fields

This means that for each $t\in I$, the map $V_t: M\to TM$ defined by $V_t(\mathbf{p}) = V(t,\mathbf{p})$ is a vector field on $M$. If $V$ is a time-dependent vector field on $M$, an *integral curve* of $V$ is a differentiable curve $\gamma: I_0 \to M$, where $I_0\subseteq I$, such that

There exist an open subset $\mathcal{E} \subseteq I \times I \times M$ and a smooth map $\psi:\mathcal{E} \to M$ called the *time-dependent flow* of $V$, with the following properties:
1. For each $t_0 \in I$ and $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the set $\mathcal{E}^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})} = \Set{t\in I | (t, t_0, \mathbf{p})\in\mathcal{E}}$ is an open interval containing $t_0$, and the smooth curve $\psi^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}: \mathcal{E}^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})} \to M$ defined by $\psi^{(t_0, \mathbf{p})}(t) = \psi(t,t_0,\mathbf{p})$ is the unique maximal integral curve of $V$ with initial condition $\psi^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}(t_0) = \mathbf{p}$.
2. If $t_1 \in\mathcal{E}^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}$ and $\mathbf{q} = \psi^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}(t_1)$, then $\mathcal{E}^{(t_1,\mathbf{q})} = \mathcal{E}^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}$ and $\psi^{(t_1, \mathbf{q})} = \psi^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}$.
3. For each $(t_1,t_0)\in I\times I$, the set $M_{t_1,t_0} = \Set{\mathbf{p}\in M | (t_1,t_0,\mathbf{p})\in\mathcal{E}}$ is open in $M$, and the map $\psi_{t_1,t_0}: M_{t_1,t_0} \to M$ defined by $\psi_{t_1,t_0}(\mathbf{p}) = \psi(t_1,t_0,\mathbf{p})$ is a diffeomorphism from $M_{t_1,t_0}$ onto $M_{t_0,t_1}$ with inverse $\psi_{t_0,t_1}$.
4. If $\mathbf{p}\in M_{t_1, t_0}$ and $\psi_{t_1, t_0}(\mathbf{p}) \in M_{t_2,t_1}$, then $\mathbf{p}\in M_{t_2,t_0}$ and

Consider the smooth vector field $\tilde{V}$ on $I\times M$ defined bY

$$
  \tilde{V}_{(s,\mathbf{p})} = \left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\right|_s, V(s,\mathbf{p}) \right)
$$

where $s$ is the standard coordinate on $I\subseteq\R$, and we identify $T_{(s,\mathbf{p})}(I\times M)$ with $T_s I \otimes T_\mathbf{p} M$ as usual. Let $\tilde{\theta}:\tilde{\mathcal{D}} \to I\times M$ denote the flow of $\tilde{V}$. If we write the component function of $\tilde{\theta}$ as

$$
  \tilde{\theta}(t,(s,\mathbf{p})) = (\alpha(t,(s,\mathbf{p})), \beta(t,(s,\mathbf{p})))
$$

then $\alpha:\tilde{D}\to I$ and $\beta:\tilde{D}\to M$ satisfy

$$
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial t}(t,(s,\mathbf{p})) =& 1,\; \alpha(0,(s,\mathbf{p})) = s \\
  \frac{\partial\beta}{\partial t}(t,(s,\mathbf{p})) =& V(\alpha(t,(s,\mathbf{p})), \beta(t,(s,\mathbf{p}))),\; \beta(0,(s,\mathbf{p})) = \mathbf{p}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows immediately that $\alpha(t,(s,\mathbf{p})) = t + s$, and therefore $\beta$ satisfies

$$
  \frac{\partial\beta}{\partial t}(t,(s,\mathbf{p})) = V(t + s,\beta(t(s,\mathbf{p})))
$$

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be the subset of $\R\times I\times M$ defined bY

$$
  \mathcal{E} = \Set{(t,t_0,\mathbf{p}) | (t-t_0, (t_0,\mathbf{p}))\in\tilde{D}}
$$

Clearly, $\mathcal{E}$ is open in $\R\times I\times M$ because $\tilde{D}$ is. Moreover, since $\alpha$ maps $\tilde{D}$ into $I$, if $(t,t_0,\mathbf{p})\in\mathcal{E}$, then $t = \alpha(t-t_0,(t_0,\mathbf{p}))\in I$, which implies that $\mathcal{E}\subseteq I\times I\times M$.

The fact that each set $M_{t_1,t_0} = \Set{\mathbf{p}\in M | (t_1,t_0,\mathbf{p})\in\mathcal{E}}$ is open in $M$ follow immediately from the fact that $\mathcal{E}$ is open.

Defined $\psi:\mathcal{E}\to M$ bY

$$
  \psi(t,t_0,\mathbf{p}) = \beta(t-t_0,(t_0,\mathbf{p}))
$$

Then $\psi$ is smooth because $\beta$ is, and it follows from the differential condition on $\beta$ that $\psi^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}(t) = \psi(t,t_0,\mathbf{p})$ is an integral curve of $V$ with initial condition $\psi^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})} = \mathbf{p}$.

To prove uniqueness, suppose that $t_0\in I$, and that $\gamma:I_0\to M$ is any integral curve of $V$ defined on some open interval $I_0\subseteq I$ containing $t_0$ and satisfying $\gamma(t_0) = \mathbf{p}$. Define a smooth curve $\tilde{\gamma}:I_0 \to I\times M$ by $\tilde{\gamma}(t) = (t,\gamma(t))$. Then $\tilde{\gamma}$ is easily seen to be an integral curve of $\tilde{V}$ with initial condition $\tilde{\gamma}(t) = \tilde{\theta}(t-t_0, (t_0,\mathbf{p}))$ on its whole domain, which implies that the domain of $\gamma$ is contained in that of $\psi^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}$, and $\gamma=\psi^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}$ on that domain. It follows that $\psi^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}$ is the unique maximal integral curve of $V$ passing through $\mathbf{p}$ at $t=t_0$. This completes the proof of **(1)**.

To prove **(2)**, suppose that $t_1\in\mathcal{E}^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}$ and $\mathbf{q} = \psi^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}(t_1)$. Then both $\psi^{(t_1,\mathbf{q})}$, and $\psi^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}$ are integral curves of $V$ that pass through $\mathbf{q}$ when $t = t_1$, so by the uniqueness and maximality they must have the same domain and be equal on that domain.

Next, we prove **(4)**. Suppose that $\mathbf{p}\in M_{t_1,t_0}$ and $\psi_{t_1,t_0}(\mathbf{p})\in M_{t_2, t_1}$, and set $\mathbf{q} = \psi_{t_1,t_0}(\mathbf{p}) = \psi^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}(t_1)$. Then **(2)** implies that $\psi^{(t_1,\mathbf{q})}(t_2) = \psi^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})}(t_2)$. Unwinding the definitions yields

$$
  \psi_{t_2,t_1}\circ\psi_{t_1,t_0}(\mathbf{p}) = \psi_{t_2,t_0}(\mathbf{p})
$$

Finally, we prove **(3)**. Suppose that $(t_1,t_0)\in I\times I$. We have already noted that $M_{t_1,t_0}$ is open in $M$. To show that $\psi_{t_1,t_0}(M_{t_1,t_0})\subseteq M_{t_0,t_1}$, let $\mathbf{p}$ be a pint of $M_{t_1,t_0}$, and set $\mathbf{q} = \psi_{t_1,t_0}(\mathbf{p})$. Part **(2)** implies that $\mathcal{E}^{(t_0, \mathbf{q})} = \mathcal{E}^{(t_1,\mathbf{q})}$, and thus $t_0\in\mathcal{E}^{(t_0,\mathbf{p})} = \mathcal{E}^{(t_1,\mathbf{q})}$. This is equivalent to $(t_0,t_1,\mathbf{q})\in\mathcal{E}$, which in turn means $\mathbf{q}\in M_{t_0,t_1}$ as claimed. To shet $\psi_{t_1,t_0}: M_{t_1,t_0} \to M_{t_0,t_1}$ is a diffeomorphism, just note that the same argument as above implies that $\psi_{t_0,t_1}(M_{t_0,t_1})\subseteq M_{t_1,t_0}$, and then **(4)** implies that $\psi_{t_1, t_0}\circ\psi_{t_0,t_1}(\mathbf{p}) = \psi_{t_1,t_1}(\mathbf{p}) =\mathbf{p}$ for all $\mathbf{p}\in M_{t_0,t_1}$, and similarly that $\psi_{t_0,t_1}\circ\psi_{t_1,t_0}(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{q}$ for $\mathbf{q}\in M_{t_1,t_0}$.

## First-order partial differential equations

In coordinates, any first order partial differential differential equation (PDE) can be written

$$
  F\left( x^1,\dots, x^n, u(x), \frac{\partial u}{\partial x^1}(x),\dots,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x^n}(x) \right) = 0
$$

where $u$ is an unknown function of $n$ variables, and $F$ is a given smooth (not strictly necessary) function of $2n+1$ variables. In the following theory, both $u$ and $F$ are assumed to be real-valued. Most PDEs have a multitude of solutions, and in order to get a unique solution one generally stipulates that the solution should satisy some extra conditions. For first-order equations, the appropriate condition is to specify "initial value" on a hypersurface: given a smooth hypersurface $S\subseteq\R^n$ and a smooth function $\varphi:S\to\R$, we seek a smooth function $u$ that solves the PDE and also satisfies the initial condition

$$
  u|_S = \varphi
$$

The problem of finding a solution to a PDE given an initial condition is called a *Cauchy problem*.

### Linear equations

A linear first-order PDE depends linearly or affinely on the unknown function and its derivatives. In coordinate form, the most general linear PDE takes the form

$$
  b(\mathbf{x})u(\mathbf{x}) + \sum_{i=1}^n a^i(\mathbf{x})\frac{\partia u}{\partial x^i}(x) = f(\mathbf{x})
$$

where $a^i$, $b$ and $f$ are smooth, real-valued functions defined on some open subset $\Omega\subseteq\R^n$ and $u$ is an unknown smooth function on $\Omega$. The partial derivatives represent the action on $u$ of a smooth vector field $A\in\mathfrak{X}(\Omega)$

$$
  A_\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n a^i(\mathbf{x}) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{x}
$$

In terms of $A$, the linear first order PDE takes the simple form $Au + bu = f$. The Cauchy problem for $Au + bu = f$ with initial hypersurface $S$ is called *noncharacteristic* if $A$ is nowhere tangent to $S$.

<MathBox title='The linear first-order Cauchy problem' boxType='theorem'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. Suppose that $S\subseteq M$ is an embedded hypersurface, and that $A\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ is a smooth vector field that is nowhere tangent to $S$. Given functions $b,f\in C^\infty (M)$ and $\varphi\in C^\infty (S)$, then for some neighbourhood $U$ of $S$ in $M$, there exists a unique solution $u\in C^\infty (U)$ to the noncharacteristic Cauchy problem

$$
\begin{align*}
  Au + bu =& f \\
  u|_S =& \varphi
\end{align*}
$$

<summary>Proof</summary>

The flowout theorem gives us a neighbourhood $\mathcal{O}_\delta$ of $\Set{0}\times S$ in $\R\times S$, a neighbourhood $U$ of $S$ in $M$, and a diffeomorphism $\Phi:\mathcal{O}_\delta\to U$ that satisfies $\Phi(0,\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{p}$ for $\mathbf{p}\in S$ and $\Phi_* \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right) = A$. Let us write $\hat{u} = u\circ\Phi$, $\hat{f} = f\circ\Phi$, and $\hat{b} = b\circ\Phi$. Since $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ and $A$ are $\Phi$-related it follows that $\frac{\partial\hat{u}}{\partial t} = (Au)\circ\Phi$. Thus, $u\in C^\infty (U)$ satisfies the Cauchy problem if and only if

$$
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial\hat{u}}{\partial t}(t,\mathbf{p}) =& \hat{f}(t,\mathbf{p}) - \hat{b}(t,\mathbf{p})\hat{u}(t,\mathbf{p}),\; (t,\mathbf{p})\in\mathcal{O}_\delta \\
  \hat{u}(0,\mathbf{p}) = \varphi(\mathbf{p})
\end{align*}
$$

For each fixed $\mathbf{p}\in S$, this is a linear first-order ODE initial value problem for $\hat{u}$ on the interval $-\delta(\mathbf{p}) < t \delta(\mathbf{p})$. Such a probelm always has a unique solution on the whole interval, given by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \hat{u}(t,\mathbf{p}) =& e^{-B(t,\mathbf{p})} \left(\varphi(\mathbf{p}) + \int_0^t \hat{f}(\tau,\mathbf{p})e^{B(\tau,\mathbf{p})}\;\mathrm{d}\tau \right) \\
  B(\tau,\mathbf{p}) =& \int_0^\tau \hat{b}(\sigma,\mathbf{p})\;\mathrm{d}\sigma
\end{align*}
$$

The solution $\hat{u}$ is a smooth function of $(t,\mathbf{p})$. Thus, $u = \hat{u}\circ\Phi^{-1}$ is the unique solution on $U$.

### Quasilinear equations

A *quasilinear* PDE can be written as an affine equation in the highest-order derivatives of the unknown function, with coefficients that may depend on the function itself and its derivatives of lower order. In coordinates, a *quasilinear* first-order PDE takes the form

$$
  \sum_{i=1}^n a^i (\mathbf{x}, u(\mathbf{x})) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x^i} = f(\mathbf{x}, u(\mathbf{x}))
$$

for an unknown function $u(x^1,\dots,x^n)$, where $a^i$ and $f$ are smooth real-valued functions defined on some open subset $W\subseteq\R^{n+1}$. Let $S\subseteq\R^n$ be a smooth, embedded hypersurface, and $\varphi:S\to\R$ a smooth function whose graphi is contained in $W$. A quasilinear Cauchy problem with initial condition $u|_S = \varphi$, is noncharacteristic if the vector field $A^\varphi$ along $S$ defined bY

$$
  A^\varphi|_\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n a^i (\mathbf{x}, \varphi(\mathbf{x})) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{x} 
$$

is nowhere tangent to $S$.

<MathBox title='The quasilinear Cauchy problem' boxType='theorem'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. Suppose that $S\subseteq M$ is an embedded hypersurface, and that $A\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ is a smooth vector field that is nowhere tangent to $S$. Given functions $b,f\in C^\infty (M)$ and $\varphi\in C^\infty (S)$, then for some neighbourhood $U$ of $S$ in $M$, there exists a unique solution $u\in C^\infty (U)$ to the noncharacteristic Cauchy problem

$$
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{i=1}^n a^i (\mathbf{x}, u(\mathbf{x})) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x^i} =& f(\mathbf{x}, u(\mathbf{x})) \\
  u|_S =& \varphi
\end{align*}
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The key is to conver the dependent variable $u$ to an additional independent variable. Define the characteristic vector field for the quasilinear PDE to be the vector field $\xi$ on $W\subseteq\R^{n+1}$ given bY

$$
  \xi_{\mathbf{x},z} = f(\mathbf{x}, z) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right|_{(\mathbf{x}, z)} + \sum_{i=1}^n a^i(\mathbf{x},z) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_{(\mathbf{x},z)}
$$

Suppose that $u$ is a smooth function defined on an open subset $V\subseteq\R^n$ whose graph $\Gamma(u) = \Set{(\mathbf{x}, u(\mathbf{x})) | \mathbf{x}\in V}$ is contained in $W$. Then the quasilinear PDE hold if and only if $\xi(z - u(\mathbf{x})) = 0$ at all points of $\Gamma(u)$. Since $z - u(\mathbf{x})$ is a defining function for $\Gamma(u)$ it follows that $u$ solves the quasilinear PDE if and only if $\xi$ is tangent to $\Gamma(u)$. The idea is to construct the graph of $u$ as the flowout by $\xi$ from a suitable initial submanifold.

Let $\Gamma(\varphi) = \Set{(\mathbf{x}, \varphi(\mathbf{x})) | \mathbf{x}\in S}$ denote the graph of $\varphi$, which is an $(n-1)$-dimensional embedded submanifold of $W$. The projection $\pi: W\to\R^n$ onto the first $n$ variables maps $\Gamma(\varphi)$ diffeomorphically onto $S$, so if $\xi$ were tangent to $\Gamma(\varphi)$ at some point $(\mathbf{x},\varphi(\mathbf{x}))$, then $\mathrm{d}\phi(\xi_{(\mathbf{x}, \varphi(x))})$ would be tangent to $S$ at $\mathbf{x}$. However, a direct computation shows that

$$
  \mathrm{d}\phi(\xi_{(\mathbf{x}, \varphi(x))}) = A^\varphi|_\mathbf{x}
$$

so the noncharacteristic assumption guarantees that $\xi$ is nowhere tangent to $\Gamma(\varphi)$.

Applying the flowout theorem to the vector field $\xi$ starting on $\Gamma(\varphi)\subseteq W$, we obtain an immersed $n$-dimensional submanifold $\mathcal{R}\subseteq W$ containing $\Gamma(\varphi)$, such that $\xi$ is everywhere tangent to $\mathcal{R}$. If we can show that $\mathcal{R}$ is the graph of a smooth function $u$, at least locally near $\Gamma(\varphi)$, then $u$ will be a solution to the Cauchy problem.

Let $\mathbf{p}\in S$ be arbitrary. At $(\mathbf{p},\varphi(\mathbf{p}))\in\Gamma(\varphi)\subseteq \mathcal{R}$, the tangent space to $\mathcal{R}$ is spanned by the vector $\xi_{(\mathbf{p}, \varphi(\mathbf{p}))}$ together with $T_{(\mathbf{p}, \varphi(\mathbf{p}))} \Gamma(\varphi)$. The restriction of $\pi$ to $\Gamma(\varphi)$ is a diffeomorphism onto $S$, so $\mathrm{d}\pi$ maps $T_{(\mathbf{p}, \varphi(\mathbf{p}))}\Gamma(\varphi)$ isomorphically onto $T_\mathbf{p}S$. On the other hand, $\mathrm{d}\pi$ takes $\xi_{(\mathbf{p},\varphi(\mathbf{p}))}$ to $A^\varphi|_\mathbf{p}$. By the noncharacteristic assumption, $A^\varphi|_\mathbf{p} \notin T_\mathbf{p} S$, so $\mathbf{d}\pi$ is injective on $T_{(\mathbf{p}, \varphi(\mathbf{p}))} \mathcal{R}$, and thus for dimensional reasons $T_{(\mathbf{p},\varphi(\mathbf{p}))}\R^{n+1} = T_{(\mathbf{p}, \varphi(\mathbf{p}))} \mathcal{R} \otimes \mathrm{ker}\left(\mathrm{d}\pi_{(\mathbf{p}, \varphi(\mathbf{p}))} \right)$. Because $\mathrm{ker}\left(\mathrm{d}\pi_{(\mathbf{p}, \varphi(\mathbf{p}))} \right)$ is the tangent space to $\Set{\mathbf{p}}\times\R$, it follows that $\mathcal{R}$ intersects $\Set{\mathbf{p}}\times\R$ transversely at $(\mathbf{p},\varphi(\mathbf{p}))$. By local characterization of graphs, there exists a neighbourhood $V$ of $(\mathbf{p},\varphi(\mathbf{p}))$ in $\mathcal{R}$ and a neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{p}\in\R^n$ such that $V$ is the graph of a smooth function $u: U\to\R$. This function solves the Cauchy problem in $U$.

To prove uniqueness, we might need to shrink $U$. Because $\mathcal{R}$ is a flowout, it is the image of some open subset $\mathcal{O}_\delta \subseteq\R\times\Gamma(\varphi(\mathbf{p}))$ under the flow of $\xi$. Choose $V$ small enough that it is the image under flow of a set of the form $(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)\times Y\subseteq \mathcal{O}_\delta$, for some $\varepsilon > 0$ and some neighbourhood $Y$ of $(\mathbf{p},\varphi(\mathbf{p}))$ in $\Gamma(\varphi)$. With this assumption, $\Gamma(u)$ is exactly the union of the images of the integral curves of $\xi$ starting at points of $Y$ and flowing for time $|t| < \varepsilon$. 

Suppose that $\tilde{u}$ is any other solution to the same Cauchy problem on the same open subset $U$. As noted above, this means that $\xi$ is tangent to the graph of $\tilde{u}$, and the initial condition ensures that $Y = \Gamma(\varphi) \cap U \subseteq \Gamma(\tilde{u})$. Since the graph of $\tilde{u}$ is a properly embedded submanifold of $U\times\R$, then each integral curve of $\xi$ in $U\times\R$ starting at a point of $Y$ must lie entirely in the graph of $\tilde{u}$. Thus $\Gamma(\tilde{u}) \subseteq \Gamma(u)$. However, then $\Gamma(\tilde{u})$ cannot contain any point that are not in $\Gamma(u)$ and still be graph of a function, so $\tilde{u} = u$ on $U$.

To find an explicit solution to a quasilinear Cauchy problem, we begin by choosin a smooth local parametrization of $S$, written as $\mathbf{s}\mapsto X(\mathbf{s})$ for $\mathbf{s} = (s^2,\dots,s^n)\in \Omega\subseteq\R^{n-1}$. Then the map $\tilde{X}:\Omega\to\R^{n+1}$ given by $\tilde{X}(\mathbf{s}) = (X(\mathbf{s}),\varphi(X(\mathbf{s})))$ is a local parametrization of $\Gamma(\varphi)$, and a local parametrization of $\mathcal{R}$ is given by

$$
  \Psi(t,\mathbf{s}) = \theta_t (\tilde{X}(\mathbf{s}))
$$

where $\theta$ is the flow of $\xi$. To rewrite $\mathcal{R}$ as a graph, just invert the map $\pi\circ\Psi:\Omega\to\R^n$ locally by solving for $(x^1,\dots,x^n)$ in terms of $(t,s^2,\dots,s^n)$. Then the $z$-component of $\Psi$, written as a function of $(x^1,\dots,x^n)$, is a solution to the Cauchy problem.

# Vector bundles

<MathBox title='Vector bundle' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a topological space. A (real) *vector bundle* of rank $k$ over $M$ is a topological space $E$ together with a surjective continuous map $\pi:E\to M$ satisfying:
1. For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the fiber $E_\mathbf{p} = \pi^{-1}(\mathbf{p})$ over $\mathbf{p}$ is endowed with the structure of a $k$-dimensional real vector space.
2. For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, there exist a neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{p}$ in $M$ and a homomorphism $\Phi: \pi^{-1}(U) \to U\times\R^k$, called a *local trivialization* of $E$ over $U$, satisfying the following conditions:
    - $\pi_U \circ\Phi = \pi$, where $\pi_U: U\times\R^k \to U$ is the projection
    - for each $\mathbf{q}\in U$, the restriction of $\Phi$ to $E_\mathbf{q}$ is a vector space isomorphism from $E_\mathbf{q}$ to $\Set{\mathbf{q}}\times\R^k \cong \R^k$

The space $E$ is called the *total space of the bundle*, $M$ is called its *base*, and $\pi$ is its projection. If $M$ and $E$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, $\pi$ is a smooth map, and the local trivialization can be chosen to be diffeomorphisms, then $E$ is a *smooth vector bundle*. In this case, we call any local trivialization that is a diffeomorphism onto its image a *smooth local trivialization*. 

If there exists a local trivialization of $E$ over all of $M$, called a *global trivialization* of $E$, then $E$ is said to be a *trivial bundle*. In this case, $E$ itself is homeomorphic to the product space $M\times\R^k$. If $E\to M$ is a smooth bundle that admits a smooth global trivialization, then $E$ is *smoothly trivial*. In this case $E$ is diffeomorphic to $M\times\R^k$.

A rank-$1$ vector bundle is often called a *line bundle*.

<MathBox title='The tangent bundle as a vector bundle' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary, and let $TM$ be its tangent bundle. With its standard projection map, its natural vector space structure on each fiber, and the topology and smooth structure, $TM$ is a smooth vector bundle of rank $n$ over $M$.

Given any smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ with coordinate functions $(x^j)$, define a map $\Phi:\pi^{-1} (U)\to U\times\R^n$ by

$$
  \Phi\left(v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p}\right) = (\mathbf{p}, (v^1,\dots,v^n))
$$

This is linear on fibers and satisfies $\pi_1 \circ\Phi = \pi$. The composite map

$$
  \pi^{-1}(U) \xrightarrow{\Phi} U\times\R^n \xrightarrow{\varphi\times\mathrm{id}_{\R^n}} \varphi(U)\times\R^n
$$

is equal to the coordinate map $\tilde{\varphi}: \pi^{-1}(U) \to\R^{2n}$ given by

$$
  \tilde{\varphi}\left(v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} \right) = (x^1(\mathbf{p}),\dots,x^n(\mathbf{p}), v^1,\dots,v^n)
$$

Since both $\tilde{\varphi}$ and $\varphi\times\mathrm{id}_{\R^n}$ are diffeomorphisms, so is $\Phi$. Thus, $\Phi$ satisfies all the conditions for a smooth local trivialization.

Let $\pi:E\to M$ be a smooth vector bundle of rank $k$ over a smooth manifold $M$. Suppose that $\Phi:\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times\R^k$ and $\Psi:\pi^{-1}(V)\to V\times\R^k$ are two smooth local trivializations of $E$ with $U\cap V \neq\emptyset$. There exists a smooth map $\tau: U\cap V \to\mathrm{GL}(k, \R)$ such that the composition $\Phi\circ\Ps{-1}: (U\cap V)\times\R^k \to (U\cap V)\times\R^k$ has the form

$$
  \Phi\circ\Psi^{-1}(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{v}) = (\mathbf{p}, \tau(\mathbf{p})\mathbf{v})

where $\tau(\mathbf{p})\mathbf{v}$ denotes the usual action of the $k\times k$ matrix $\tau(\mathbf{p})$ on the vector $\mathbf{v}\in\R^k$.

The following diagram commutes:

$$
\begin{CD}
  (U\cap V)\times\R^k @<{\Psi^{-1}}<< \pi^{-1}(U\cap V) @>{\Phi}>> (U\cap V)\times\R^k \\
  @V{\pi_1}VV @V{\pi}VV @VV{\pi_1}V \\
  U\cap V @= U\cap V @= U\cap V
\end{CD}
$$

where the maps on top are to be interpreted as the restrictions of $\Psi$ and $\Phi$ to $\pi^{-1}(U\cap V)$. It follows that $\pi_1 \circ(\Phi\circ\Psi^{-1}) = \pi_1$, which means That

$$
  \Phi\circ\Psi^{-1}(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{v}) = (\mathbf{p}, \sigma(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{v}))
$$
for some smooth map $\sigma: (U\cap V)\times\R^k \to\R^k$. Moreover, for each fixed $\mathbf{p}\in U\cap V$, the map $\mathbf{v}\mapsto\sigma(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{v})$ from $\R^k$ to itself is an invertible linear map, so there is a nonsingular $k\times k$ matrix $\tau(\mathbf{p})$ such that $\sigma(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{v}) = \tau(\mathbf{p})\mathbf{v}$. It remains to show that the transition map $\tau: U\cap V\to\mathrm{GL}(k,\R)$ is smooth.

<MathBox title='Vector bundle chart lemma' boxType='lemma'>
Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary, and suppose that for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, we are given a real vector space $E_\mathbf{p}$ of some fixed dimension $k$. Let $E = \bigsqcup_{\mathbf{p}\in M} E_\mathbf{p}$, and let $\pi:E\to M$ be the map that takes each element of $E_\mathbf{p}$ to the point $\mathbf{p}$. Suppose furthermore that we are given the following data:
1. an open cover $\Set{U_\alpha}_{\alpha\in A}$ of $M$
2. for each $\alpha\in A$, a bijective map $\Phi_\alpha:\pi^{-1}(U_\alpha)\to U_\alpha\times\R^k$ whose restriction to each $E_\mathbf{p}$ is a vector space isomorphism from $E_\mathbf{p}$ to $\Set{\mathbf{p}}\times\R^k \cong\R^k$
3. for each $\alpha,\beta\in A$ with $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \neq\emptyset$, a smooth map $\tau_{\alpha\beta}: U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \to \mathrm{GL}(k,\R)$ such that the map $\Phi_\alpha \circ\Phi_\beta^{-1}$ from $(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta)\times\R^k$ to itself has the form

$$
  \Phi_\alpha \circ \Phi_\beta^{-1} (\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{v}) = (\mathbf{p}, \tau_{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf{p})\mathbf{v})
$$

Then $E$ has a unique topology and smooth structure making it into a smooth manifold with or without boundary and a smooth rank-$k$ vector bundle over $M$, with $\pi$ as projection and $\Set{(U_\alpha, \Phi_\alpha)}$ as smooth local trivializations.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

For each point $\mathbf{p}\in M$, choose some $U_\alpha$ containing $\mathbf{p}$; choose a smooth chart $(V_\mathbf{p}, \varphi_\mathbf{p})$ for $M$ such that $\mathbf{p}\in V_\mathbf{p}\subseteq U_\alpha$, and let $\hat{V}_\mathbf{p} = \varphi_\mathbf{p}(V_\mathbf{p}) \subseteq\R^n$ or $H^n$. Define a map $\tilde{\varphi}_\mathbf{p} = \pi^{-1}(V_\mathbf{p}) \to\hat{V}_\mathbf{p} \times\R^k$ by $\tilde{\varphi}_\mathbf{p} = (\varphi_\mathbf{p} \times\mathrm{id}_{\R^k})$\circ\Phi_\alpha$ such that

$$
  \pi^{-1}(V_\mathbf{p}) \xrightarrow{\Phi_\alpha} V_\mathbf{p}\times\R^k \xrightarrow{\varphi_\mathbf{p}\times\mathrm{id}_{\R^k}} \hat{V}_\mathbf{p}\times\R^k
$$

We will show that the collection of all such charts $\Set{(\pi^{-1}(V_\mathbf{p}), \tilde{\varphi}) | \mathbf{p}\in M}$ satisfies the conditions of the smooth manifold chart lemma, and therefore give $E$ the strcuture of a smooth manifold with or without boundary.

As a composition of bijective maps, $\tilde{\varphi}_\mathbf{p}$ is bijective onto an open subset of either $\R^n \times\R^k = \R^{n+k}$ or $H^n \times\R^n \approx H^{n+k}$. For any $\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}\in M$, it is easy to check that

$$
  \tilde{\varphi}_\mathbf{p}(\pi^{-1}(V_\mathbf{p}) \cap \pi^{-1}(V_\mathbf{q})) = \varphi_\mathbf{p}(V_\mathbf{p} \cap V_\mathbf{q}) \times\R^k
$$

which is open because $\varphi_\mathbf{p}$ is a homeomorphism onto an open subset of $\R^n$ or $H^n$. Wherever two such charts overlap, we have

$$
  \tilde{\varphi}_\mathbf{p} \circ\tilde{\varphi}_\mathbf{q}^{-1} = (\varphi_\mathbf{p} \times\mathrm{id}_{\R^k}) \circ \Phi_\alpha \circ\Phi_\beta^{-1}\circ(\varphi_\mathbf{q} \times \mathrm{id}_{\R^k})^{-1}
$$

Since $\varpho_\mathbf{p} \times \mathrm{id}_{\R^k}, \varphi_\mathbf{q}\times\mathrm{id}_{\R^k}$ and $\Phi_\alpha \circ \Phi_\beta^{-1}$ are diffeomorphisms, the compositions is a diffeomorphism. Thus, the first three conditions of the smooth manifold lemma chart are satisfied. Because the open cover $\Set{V_\mathbf{p} | \mathbf{p}\in M}$ has a countable subcover, the fourt condition of the lemma is satisfied as well.

To check the Hausdorff condition, note that any two points in the same space $E_\mathbf{p}$ lie in one of the charts we have constructed, whiel if $\xi\in E_\mathbf{p}$, and $\eta\in E_\mathbf{q}$ with $\mathbf{p}\neq\mathbf{q}$ we can choose $V_\mathbf{p}$ and $V_\mathbf{q}$ to be disjoint neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$, so that the sets $\pi^{-1}(V_\mathbf{p})$ and $\pi^{-1}(V_\mathbf{q})$ are disjoint coordinate neighbourhoods containing $\xi$ and $\eta$, respectively. Thus, we have given $E$ the structure of a smooth manifold with or without boundary.

With respect to this structure, each of the maps $\Phi_\alpha$ is a diffeomorphism, because in terms of the coordinate charts $(\pi^{-1}(V_\mathbf{p}), \tilde{\varphi}_\mathbf{p})$ for $E$ and $(V_\mathbf{p}\times\R^k, \varphi_\mathbf{p} \times\mathrm{id}_{\R^k})$ for $V_\mathbf{p}\times\R^k$, the coordinate representation of $\Phi_\alpha$ is the identity map. The coordinate representation of $\pi$, with respect to the same chart for $E$ and the chart $(V_\mathbf{p}, \varphi_\mathbf{p})$ for $M$, is $\pi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{x}$, so $\pi$ is smooth as well. Because each $\Phi_\alpha$ maps $E_\mathbf{p}$ to $\Set{\mathbf{p}}\times\R^k$, it is immediate that $\pi_1 \circ\Phi_\alpha = \pi$, and $\Phi_\alpha$ is linear on fibers by hypothesis. Thus, $\Phi_\alpha$ satisfies all the conditions for a smooth local trivialization.

The fact that this is the uniqe smooth structure follows easily from the requirement that the maps $\Phi_\alpha$ be diffeomorphisms onto their images: any smooth structure satisfying the same conditions must include all of the charts we constructed, so it is equal to this one.

## Local and global sections of vector bundles

<MathBox title='Vector bundle section' boxType='definition'>
Let $\pi:E\to M$ be a vector bundle. A *(cross) section* of $E$ is a section of the map $\pi$, i.e. a continuous map $\sigma:M\to E$ satisfying $\pi\circ\sigma = \mathrm{id}_M$. This means that $\sigma(\mathbf{p})$ is an element of the fiber $E_\mathbf{p}$ for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$. If $\sigma$ is not necessarily continuous, it is called a *rough section*. 

More generally, a *local section* of $E$ is a continuous map $\sigma:U\to E$ defined on some open subset $U\subseteq M$ and satisfying $\pi\circ\sigma = \mathrm{id}_U$. To emphasize the distinction, a section deifned on all of $M$ is sometimes called a *global section*. Note that the local section of $E$ over $U\subseteq M$ is the same as a global section of the restricted bundle $E|_U$. If $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary and $E$ is a smooth vector bundle, a *smooth section* of $E$ is one that is a smooth map from its domain to $E$.

The *zero section* of $E$ is the global section $\zeta:M\to E$ defined by

$$
  \zeta(\mathbf{p}) = 0\in E_\mathbf{p},\; \forall \mathbf{p}\in M
$$

The *support* of a section $\sigma$ is the set

$$
  \mathrm{supp}(\sigma) = \overline{\Set{\mathbf{p}\in M | \sigma(\mathbf{p}) \neq 0}}
$$

If $E\to M$ is a smooth vector bundle, the set of all smooth global sections of $E$ is a vector space under point addition and scalar multiplication

$$
  (c_1 \sigma_1 + c_2 \sigma_2)(\mathbf{p}) = c_1 \sigma_1 (\mathbf{p}) + c_2 \sigma_2 (\mathbf{p}) 
$$

This vector space is usually denoted by $\Gamma(E)$. Just like smooth vector fields, smooth sections of a smooth bundle can be multiplied by smooth real-valued functions: if $f\in C^\infty(M)$ and $\sigma\in\Gamma(E)$, we obtain a new section $f\sigma$ defined by

$$
  (f\sigma)(\mathbf{p}) = f(\mathbf{p})\sigma(\mathbf{p})
$$

Every smooth local frame for a smooth vector bundle is associated with a smooth local trivialization.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $E\to M$ is a smooth vector bundle, and that $(\sigma_i)$ is a smooth local frame for $E$ over an open subset $U\subseteq M$. We define a map $\Psi:U\times\R^k \to\pi^{-1}(U)$ by

$$
  \Psi(\mathbf{p}, (\mathbf{v}^1,\dots,\mathbf{v}^k)) = v^i \sigma_i (\mathbf{p})
$$

The fact that $(\sigma_i(\mathbf{p}))$ forms a basis for $E_\mathbf{p}$ at each $\mathbf{p}\in U$ implies that $\Psi$ is bijective, and an easy computation shows that $\sigma_i = \Psi\circ\tilde{e}_i$. Thus, if we can show that $\Psi$ is a diffeomorphism, then $\Psi^{-1}$ will be a smooth local trivialization whose associated local frame is $(\sigma_i)$.

Since $\Psi$ is bijective, to show that it is a diffeomorphism it suffices to show that it is a local diffeomorphism. Given $\mathbf{q}\in U$, we can choose a neighbourhood $V$ of $\mathbf{q}$ in $M$ over which there exists a smooth local trivialization $\Phi: \pi^{-1}(V) \to V\times\R^k$, and by shrinking $V$ if necessary we may assume that $V\subseteq U$. Since $\Phi$ is a diffeomorphism, if we can show that $\Phi\circ\Psi|_{V\times\R^k}$ is a diffeomorphism from $V\times\R^k$ to itself, it follows that $\Psi$ restricts to a diffeomorphism from $V\times\R^k$ to $\pi^{-1}(V)$

$$
\begin{CD}
  V\times\R^k @>{\Psi|_{V\times\R^k}}>> \pi^{-1}(V) @>{\Phi}>> V\times\R^k \\
  @V{\pi_1}VV @V{\pi}VV $VV{\pi_1}V \\
  V @= V @= V
\end{CD}
$$

For each of our smooth sections $\sigma_i$, the composite map $\Phi\circ\sigma_i|_V:V\to V\times\R^k$ is smooth, and thus there are smooth functions $\sigma_i^1,\dots,\sigma_i^k : V\to\R$ such that

$$
  \Phi\circ\sigma_i (\mathbf{p}) = (\mathbf{p}, (\sigma_i^1 (\mathbf{p}),\dots,\sigma_i^k(\mathbf{p})))
$$

On $V\times\R^k$, therefore

$$
  \Phi\circ\Psi(\mathbf{p}, (v^1,\dots,v^k)) = (\mathbf{p}, (v^i\sigma_i^1(\mathbf{p}),\dots,v^i \sigma_i^k(\mathbf{p})))
$$

which is clearly smooth.

To show that $(\Phi\circ\Psi)^{-1}$ is smooth, note that the matrix $(\sigma_i^j (\mathbf{p}))$ is invertible for each $\mathbf{p}$, because $(\sigma_i(\mathbf{p}))$ is a basis for $E_\mathbf{p}$. Let $(\tau_i^j(\mathbf{p}))$ denote the inverse matrix. Because matrix inversion is a smooth map from $\mathrm{GL}(k,\R)$ to itself, the functions $\tau_i^j$ are smooth. It follows from the computations above that

$$
  (\Phi\circ\Psi)^{-1}(\mathbf{p}, (w^1,\dots,w^k)) = (\mathbf{p}, (w^i \tau_i^1(\mathbf{p}),\dots,w^i \tau_i^k(\mathbf{p})))
$$

which is also smooth.

The previous proposition shoe that there is a smooth local trivialization over an open subset $U\subseteq M$ if and only if there is a smooth local frame over $U$. The corollary is just a special case of this statement when $U = M$.

When applied to the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold $M$, this corollary says that $TM$ is trivial if and only if $M$ is parallelizable.

Let $\pi:E\to M$ be a smooth vector bundle of rank $k$ on a smooth manifold $M$, let $(V,\varphi)$ be a smooth chart on $M$ with coordinate functions $x^i$, and suppose that there exists a smooth local frame $(\sigma_i)$ for $E$ over $V$.

Just check that $\tilde{\varphi}$ is equal to the composition $(\varphi\times\mathrm{id}_{\R^k})\circ\Phi$, where $\Phi$ is the local trivialization associated with $(\sigma_i)$. As a composition of diffeomorphisms, it is a diffeomorphism.

<MathBox title='Uniqueness of the smooth structure on $TM$' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary. The tangent bundle $TM$ has a unique topology and smooth structure to which $\pi:TM\to M$ is a smooth vector bundle with the given vector space structure on the fibers, and such that all coordinate vector fields are smooth local sections.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $TM$ is endowed with some topology and smooth structure making it into a smooth vector bundle with the given properties. If $(U,\varphi)$ is any smooth chart for $M$, the corresponding coordinate frame $\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right)$ is a smooth local frame over $U$, such that there is a smooth local trivialization $\Phi:\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times\R^n$ associated with this local frame. This local trivialization is the map $\Phi:\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times\R^n$ given bY

$$
  \Phi\left( v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} \right) = (\mathbf{p}, (v^1,\dots,v^n))
$$

It follows from the previous corollary that the natural coordinate chart $\tilde{\varphi} = (\varphi\times\mathrm{id}_{\R^n})\circ\Phi$ belong to the given smooth structure. Thus, the given smooth structure is equal to one constructed in the proposition for the existence smooth structures on tangent bundles.

## Bundle homomorphisms

If $\pi:E\to M$ and $\pi': E'\to M'$ are vector bundles, a continuous map $F:E\to E'$ is a *bundle homomorphism* if there exists a map $f:M\to M'$ satisfying $\pi'\circ F = f\circ \pi$

$$
\begin{CD}
  E @>{F}>> E' \\
  @V{\pi}VV @VV{\pi'}V \\
  M @>>{f}> M'
\end{CD}
$$

with the property that for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the restricted map $F|_{E_\mathbf{p}}: E_\mathbf{p}\to E'_{f(\mathbf{p})}$ is linear. In this case $F$ is said to *cover* f.

A bijective bundle homomorphism $F:E\to E'$ whose inverse is also a bundle homomorphism, is called a *bundle isomorphism*. If $F$ is also a diffeomorphism, it is a *smooth bundle isomorphism*. If there exists a (smooth) bundle isomorphism between $E$ and $E'$, the two bundles *(smoothly) isomorphic*.

In the special case in which both $E$ and $E'$ are vector bundles over the same base space $M$, a bundle homomorphism over $M$ covers the identity map of $M$ in the form of a continuous map $F:E\to E'$ such that $\pi' \circ F = \pi$

$$
\begin{CD}
  E @>{F}>> E' \\
  @V{\pi}VV @VV{\pi'}V \\
  M @= M
\end{CD}
$$

and whose restriction to each fiber is linear. If there exists a bundle homomorphism $F:E\to E'$ over $M$ that is also a (smooth) bundle isomorphism, then we say that $E$ nad $E'$ are smoothly isomorphic over $M$.

Suppose that $E$ and $E'$ are smooth vector bundles over a smooth manifold $M$ with or without boundary, and $F:E\to E'$ is a bijective smooth bundle homomorphism over $M$. Then $F$ is a smooth bundle isomorphism.
</MathBox>

Suppose that $E\to M$ and $E' \to M$ are smooth vector bundles over a smooth manifold $M$ with or without boundary, and let $\Gamma(E)$, $\Gamma(E')$ denote their spaces of smooth global sections. If $F: E\to E'$ is a smooth bundle homomorphism over $M$, then the composition with $F$ induces a map $\tilde{F}:\Gamma(E) \to\Gamma(E')$ as follows

$$
  \tilde{F}(\sigma)(\mathbf{p}) = (F\circ\sigma)(\mathbf{p}) = F(\sigma(\mathbf{p}))
$$

It is easy to check that $\tilde{F}(\sigma)$ is a section of $E'$, and it is smooth by composition. Because a bundle homomorphism is linear on fibers, the resulting map $\tilde{F}$ on sections is linear over $\R$. In fact, it satisfies a stronger linearity property. A map $\mathcal{F}: \Gamma(E)\to\Gamma(E')$ is *linear* over $C^\infty (M)$ if for any smooth functions $u_1, u_2 \in C^\infty (M)$ and smooth sections $\sigma_1, \sigma_2 \in\Gamma(E)$,

$$
  \mathcal{F}(u_1 \sigma_1 + u_2 \sigma_2) = u_1 \mathcal{F}(\sigma_1) + u_2 \mathcal{F}(\sigma_2)
$$

If follows from that the map on sections induced by a smooth bundle homomorphism is linear over $C^\infty (M)$.

<MathBox title='Bundle homomorphism characterization lemma' boxType='lemma'>
Let $\pi:E\to M$ and $\pi':E' \to M$ be smooth vector bundles over a smooth manifold $M$ with or without boundary, and let $\Gamma(E)$, $\Gamma(E')$ denote their spaces of smooth sections. A map $\mathcal{F}: \Gamma(E)\to\Gamma(E')$ is linear over $C^\infty (M)$ if and only if there is a smooth bundle homomorphism $F:E\to E'$ over $M$ such that $\mathcal{F}(\sigma) = F\circ\sigma$ for all $\sigma\in\Gamma(E)$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Note that the map on sections induced by a smooth bundle homomorphism is linear over $C^\infty (M)$. Conversely, suppose that $\mathcal{F}:\Gamma(E)\to\Gamma(E')$ is linear over $C^\infty (M)$. First, we show that $\mathcal{F}$ acts locally: if $\sigma_1 \equiv \sigma_2$ in some open subset $U\subseteq M$, then $\mathcal{F}(\sigma_1) \equiv \mathcal{F}(\sigma_2)$ in $U$. Write $\tau = \sigma_1 - \sigma_2$; then by linearity of $\mathcal{F}$, it suffice to assume that $\tau$ vanishes in $U$ and show that $\mathcal{F}(\tau)$ does to. Given $\mathbf{p}\in U$, let $\psi\in C^\infty(M)$ be a smooth bunp function supported in $U$ and equal to $\mathbf{p}$. Because $\psi\tau$ is identically zero on $M$, the fact that $\mathcal{F}$ is linear over $C^\infty (M)$ implies

$$
  0 = \mathcal{F}(\psi\tau) = \psi\mathcal{F}(\tau)
$$

Evaluating at $\mathbf{p}$ shows that $\mathcal{F}(\tau)(\mathbf{p}) = \psi(\mathbf{p})\mathcal{F}(\tau)(\mathbf{p}) = 0$. Since the same is true for every $\mathbf{p}\in U$, the claim follows.

Next, we show that $\mathcal{F}$ actually acts pointswise: if $\sigma_1(\mathbf{p}) = \sigma_2(\mathbf{p})$, then $\mathcal{F}(\sigma_1)(\mathbf{p}) = \mathcal{F}(\sigma_2)(\mathbf{p})$. Once again, it suffices to assume that $\tau(\mathbf{p}) = 0$ and show that $\mathcal{F}(\tau)(\mathbf{p}) = 0$. Let $(\sigma_i)_{i=1}^k$ be a smooth local frame for $E$ in some neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{p}$, and write $\tau$ in terms of this fram as $\tau = u^i \sigma_i$ for some smooth functions $u^i$ defined in $U$. The fact that $\tau(\mathbf{p}) = 0$ means that $u^1 (\mathbf{p}) =\cdots= u^k(\mathbf{p}) = 0$. By the extension lemmas for vector bundles and for functions, there exist smooth global sections $\tilde{\sigma_i}\in\Gamma(E)$ that agree with $\sigma_i$ in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$, and smooth functions $\tilde{u}^i \in C^\infty(M)$ that agree with $u^i$ in some neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$. Then since $\tau = \tilde{u}^i \tilde{\sigma}_i$ of a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{F}(\tau)(\mathbf{p}) =& \mathcal{F}(\tilde{u}^i \tilde{\sigma}_i) \\
  =& \tilde{u}^i (\mathbf{p}) \mathcal{F}(\tilde{\sigma}_i)(\mathbf{p}) = 0
\end{align*}
$$

Define a bundle homomorphism $F:E\to E'$ as follows. For any $\mathbf{p}\in M$ and $\mathbf{v}\in E_\mathbf{p}$, let $F(\mathbf{v}) = \mathcal{F}(\tilde{v})(\mathbf{p})\in E'_\mathbf{p}$, where $\tilde{v}$ is any global smooth section of $E$ such that $\tilde{v}(\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{v}$. The discussion above shows that the resulting element of $E'_\mathbf{p}$ is independent of the choice of section. The map $F$ clearly satisfies $\pi\circ F = \pi$, and it is linear on each fibre because of the linearity of $\mathcal{F}$. It also satisfies $F\circ\sigma(\mathbf{p}) = \mathcal{F}(\sigma)(\mathbf{p})$ for each $\sigma\in\Gamma(E)$ by definition. It remains only to show that $F$ is smooth. It suffices to show that it is smooth in a neighbourhood of each point.

Given $\mathbf{p}\in M$, let $(\sigma_i)$ be a smooth local frame for $E$ on some neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$. By the extension lemma, there are global sections $\tilde{\sigma}_i$ that agree with $\sigma_i$ in a (smaller) neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{p}$. Shrinking $U$ if necessary, we may also assume that there exists a smooth local frame $(\sigma'_j)$ for $E'$ over $U$. Because $\mathcal{F}$ maps smooth global sections of $E$ to smooth global sections of $E'$, there are smooth functions $A_i^j \in C^\infty(U)$ such that $\mathcal{F}(\tilde{\sigma}_i)|_U = A_i^j \sigma'_j$.

For any $\mathbf{q}\in U$ and $\mathbf{v}\in E_\mathbf{p}$ we can write $\mathbf{v} = v^i \sigma_i (\mathbf{q})$ for some real numbers $(v^1,\dots,v^k)$, and Then

$$
\begin{align*}
  F(v^i \sigma_i(\mathbf{q})) =& \mathcal{F}(v^i \tilde{\sigma}_i)(\mathbf{q}) \\
  =& v^i \mathcal{F}(\tilde{\sigma}_i)(\mathbf{q}) \\
  =& v^i A_i^j (\mathbf{q}) \sigma'_j (\mathbf{q})
\end{align*}
$$

because $v^i \tilde{\sigma}_i$ is a global smooth section of $E$ whose value at $\mathbf{q}$ is $\mathbf{v}$. If $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ denote the local trivializations of $E$ and $E'$ associated with the frames $(\sigma_i)$ and $(\sigma'_i)$, respectively, it follows that the composite map $\Phi' \circ F \circ\Phi^{-1}: U\times\R^k \to U\times \R^m$ has the form

$$
  \Phi' \circ F\circ\Phi^{-1}(\mathbf{q}, (v^1,\dots,v^k)) = (\mathbf{q}, A_i^1 (\mathbf{q})v^i, \dots, A_i^m (\mathbf{q})v^i)
$$

which is smooth. Because $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are diffeomorphisms, this shows that $F$ is smooth on $\pi^{-1}(U)$.

## Subbundles

<MathBox title='Subbundle' boxType='definition'>
Give a vector bundle $\pi_E: E\to M$, a *subbundle* of $E$ is a vector bundle $\pi_D: D\to M$, in which $D$ is a topological subspace of $E$ and $\pi_D$ is the restriction of $\pi_E$ to $D$, i.e. $\pi_D = \pi_E|_D$, such that for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the subset $D_\mathbf{p} = D \cap E_\mathbf{p}$ is a linear subspace of $E_\mathbf{p}$, and the vector space structure on $D_\mathbf{p}$ is the one inherited from $E_\mathbf{p}$. If $\pi_E$ is a smooth bundle, then $\pi_D$ is a *smooth subbundle*.

Note that the condition that $D$ be a vector bundle over $M$ implies that all of the fibers $D_\mathbf{p}$ must be nonempty and have the same dimension.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Local frame criterion for subbundles' boxType='lemma'>
Let $\pi:E\to M$ be a smooth vector bundle, and suppose that for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$ we are given an $m$-dimensional linear subspace $D_\mathbf{p}\subseteq E_\mathbf{p}$. Then $D = \bigcup_{\mathbf{p}\in M} D_\mathbf{p} \subseteq E$ is a smooth subbundle of $E$ if and only if the followin condition is satisfied: Each poin of $M$ has a neighbourhood $U$ on  which there exist smooth local sections $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_m:U\to E$ with the property that $\sigma_1(\mathbf{q}),\dots,\sigma_m(\mathbf{q})$ form a basis for $D_\mathbf{q}$ at each $\mathbf{q}\in U$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $D$ is a smooth subbundle, then by definition each $\mathbf{p}\in M$ has a neighbourhood $U$ over which there exists a smooth local trivialization of $D$. Thus, there exists a smooth local frame for $D$ over each set $U$. Such a local frame is by definition a collection of smooth sections $\tau_1,\dots,\tau_m :U\to D$ whose images form a basis for $D_\mathbf{p}$ at each point $\mathbf{p}\in U$. The smooth sections of $E$ that we seek are obtained by composing with the inclusion map $\iota: D\to E$, i.e. $\sigma_j = \iota \circ\tau_j$.

Conversely, suppose that $E\to M$ is a smooth bundle of rank $k$, and that $D\subseteq E$ satisfies the local frame criterion. Each set $D\cap E_\mathbf{p}$ is a linear subspace of $E_\mathbf{p}$ by hypothesis, so we need to show that $D$ is an embedded submanifold with or without boundary in $E$ and that the restriction of $\pi$ makes it into a smooth vector bundle over $M$.

To prove that $D$ is an embedded submanifold with or without boundary, it suffices to show that each $\mathbf{p}\in M$ has a neighbourhood $U$ such that $D\cap\pi^{-1}(U)$ is an embedded submanifold (possibly with boundary) in $\pi^{-1}(U) \subseteq E$. Given $\mathbf{p}\in M$, let $(\sigma_i)_{i=1}^m$ be smooth local sections of $E$ satisfying the local frame criterion on a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$. We can complete these to a smooth local frame $(\sigma_i)_{i=1}^k$ for $E$ over some neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{p}$. This local frame is associated with a smooth local trivialization $\Phi:\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times\R^k$, defined by

$$
  \Phi\left(\sum_{i=1}^k s^i\sigma_i(\mathbf{q})\right) = (\mathbf{q}, (s^1, \dots, s^k))
$$

This map $\Phi$ takes $D\cap \pi^{-1}(U)$ to the subset $\Set{(\mathbf{$}, (s^1,\dots,s^m,0,\dot,0))}\subseteq U\times\R^k$, which is an embedded submanifold (with boundary if $U$ has a boundary). Moreover, the map $\Psi: D\cap\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times\R^m$ defined by

$$
  \Psi(\sum_{i=1}^m s^i \sigma_i(\mathbf{q})) = (\mathbf{q}, (s^1,\dots,s^m))
$$

is a smooth local trivialization of $D$, so $D$ is itself a smooth vector bundle.

<MathBox title='Rank of bundle homomorphisms' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $E\to M$ and $E'\to M$ are vector bundles and $F:E\to E'$ is a bundle homomorphism over $M$. For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the rank of the linear $F|_{E_\mathbf{p}}$ is called the *rank* of $F$ at $\mathbf{p}$. We say that $F$ has constant rank if its rank is the same for all $\mathbf{p}\in M$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='theorem'>
Let $E$ and $E'$ be smooth vector bundles over a smooth manifold $M$, and let $F:E\to E'$ be a smooth bundle homomorphism over $M$. Define subsets $\mathrm{ker}(F \subseteq E)$ and $\mathrm{ran}(F \subseteq E')$ by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{ker}(F) =& \bigcup_{\mathbf{p}\in M} \mathrm{ker}(F|_{E_\mathbf{p}}) \\
  \mathrm{ran}(F) =& \bigcup_{\mathbf{p}\in M} \mathrm{ran}(F|_{E_\mathbf{p}})
\end{align*}
$$

Then $\mathrm{ker}(F)$ and $\mathrm{ran}(F)$ are smooth subbundles of $E$ and $E'$, respectively, if and only if $F$ has constant rank.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

One direction is obvious: since the fibers of a bundle have the same dimension everywhere, the constant rank condition is certainly necessary for $\mathrm{ker}(F)$ nad $\mathrm{ran}(F)$ to be subbundles. To prove sufficiency, suppose that $F$ has constant rank $r$, and let $k$ and $k'$ be the ranks of the bundles $E$ and $E'$ respectively. Let $\mathbf{p}\in M$ be arbitrary, and choose a smooth local frame $(\sigma_i)_{i=1}^k$ for $E$ over a neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{p}$. For each $i$, the map $F\circ\sigma_i U\to E'$ is a smooth local section of $E'$, and these sections span $\mathrm{ran}(F)|_U$. After rearranging the indices if necessary, we can assume that the elements $\Set{F\circ\sigma_i (\mathbf{p})}_{i=1}^r$ for a basis for $\mathrm{ran}(F|_{E_\mathbf{p}}$, and by continuity they remain linearly independent in some neighbourhood $U_0$ of $\mathbf{p}$. Since $F$ ha constant rank, this means that $(F\circ\sigma_i (\mathbf{p}))_{i=1}^r$ forms a smooth local frame for $\mathrm{ran}(F)$ over $U_0$. Since we can do the same in a neighbourhood of each point, the local frame criterion shows that $\mathrm{im}(F)$ is a smooth subbundle of $E'$.

To prove that $\mathrm{ker}(F)$ is also a smooth subbundle, let $U_0$ and $(\sigma_i)_{i=1}^k$ be as above, and let $V\subseteq E|_{U_0}$ be the smooth subbundle spanned by $(\sigma_i)_{i=1}^r$. The smooth bundle homomorphism $F|_V: V\to \mathrm{ran}(F)|_{U_0}$ is bijective, and is thus a smooth bundle isomorphism. Define a smooth bundle homomorphism $\Psi:E|_{U_0} \to E|_{U_0}$ by $\Psi(\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{v} - (F|_V)^{-1} \circ F(\mathbf{v})$. If $\mathbf{v}\in V$, then $F(\mathbf{v}) = (F|_V)(\mathbf{v})$, so $F(\Psi(\mathbf{v})) = F(\mathbf{v}) - F\circ (F|_V)^{-1} \circ (F|_V)(\mathbf{v}) = 0$. On the other hand, if $\mathbf{v}\in \mathrm{ker}(F)$, then $\Psi(\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{v}$, so again $F(\Psi(\mathbf{v})) = F(\mathbf{v}) = 0$. Since $V$ and $\mathrm{ker}(F)|_{U_0}$ together span $E|_{U_0}$, it follows that $\Psi$ takes its values in $\mathrm{ker}(F)|_{U_0}$, and since it restricts to the identity on $\mathrm{ker}(F)|_{U_0}$, its image is exactly $\mathrm{ker}(F)|_{U_0}$. Thus $\Psi$ has constant rank, and by the argument above, $\mathrm{ker}(F)|_{U_0} = \mathrm{ran}(\Psi)$ is a smooth subbundle of $E|_{U_0}$. Since we can do the same thing in a neighbour of each point, $\mathrm{ker}(F)$ is a smooth subbundle of $E$.

<MathBox title='Orthogonal complement bundles' boxType='lemma'>
Let $M$ be an immersed submanifold with or without boundary in $\R^n$, and $D$ be a smooth rank-$k$ subbundle of $T\R^n|_M$. For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, let $D_\mathbf{p}^\perp$ denote the orthogonal complement of $D_\mathbf{p}$ in $T_\mathbf{p}\R^n$ with respect to the Euclidean inner product, and let $D^\perp \subseteq T\R^n|_M$ be the subset

$$
  D^\perp = \Set{(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{v})\in T\R^n | \mathbf{p}\in M, \mathbf{v}\in D_\mathbf{p}^\perp}
$$

Then $D^\perp$ is a smooth rank-$(n-k)$ subbundle of $T\R^n|_M$. For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, there is a smooth orthonormal frame for $D^\perp$ on a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\mathbf{p}\in M$ be arbitrary, and let $(X_i)_{i=1}^k$ be a smooth local frame for $D$ over some neighbourhood $V$ of $\mathbf{p}$ in $M$. Because immersed submanifolds are locally embedded, by shrinking $V$ if necessary, we may assume that it is a signle slice in some coordinate ball or half-ball $U\subseteq \R^n$. Since $V$ is closed in $U$, it follows that we can complete $(X_i)_{i=1}^k$ to a smooth local frame $(\tilde{X}_i)_{i=1}^n$ for $T\R^n$ over $U$. By the Gram-Schmidt algorithm, there is a smooth orthonormal frame $(E_j)_{j=1}^k$ over $U$ such that $\mathrm{span}(E_i|_\mathbf{p})_{i=1}^k = \mathrm{span}(X_i|_\mathbf{p})_{i=1}^k = D_\mathbf{p}$ for each $\mathbf{p}\in U$. It follows that $(E_j)_{k+1}^m$ restricts to a smooth orthonormal frame for $D^\perp$ over $V$. Thus $D^\perp$ satisfies the local frame criterion, and is therefore a smooth subbundle of $T\R^n|_M$

## Fibre bundles

<MathBox title='Fibre bundle' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ and $F$ be topological spaces. A *fibre bundle* over $M$ with *model fibre* $F$ is a topolgical space $E$ together with a surjective continuous map $\pi: E\to M$ with the property that for each $\mathbf{x}\in M$, there exists a neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{x}$ in $M$ and a homeomorphism $\Phi:\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times F$ called a *local trivialization* of $E$ over $U$ such that the following diagram commutes

$$
\begin{CD}
  \pi^{-1}(U) @>{\Phi}>> U\times F \\
  @V{\pi}VV @VV{\pi_1}V \\
  U @= U
\end{CD}
$$

The space $E$ is called the *total space* of the bundle, $M$ is its *base*, and $\pi$ is its *projection*. If $E$, $M$ and $F$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, $\pi$ is a smooth map, and the local trivializations can be chosen to be diffeomorphisms, then it is called a *smooth fibre bundle*.

A *trivial fibre bundle* is one that admits a local trivialization over the entire base space (a *global trivialization*). It is said to be *smoothly trivial* if it is a smooth bundle and the global trivialization is a diffeomorphism.

## Covector

<MathBox title='Covector' boxType='definition'>
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space. A *covector* on $V$ is real-valued linear functional on $V$, i.e. a linear map $\omega: W\to\R$. The space of all covectors on $V$ is itself a real vector space called the *dual space* of $V$, denoted by $V^*$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Dual basis' boxType='proposition'>
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space. Given any basis $(\mathbf{e}_i)_{i=1}$ for $V$, let $(\varepsilon^i \in V^*)_{i=1}^n$ be the covectors defined by

$$
  \varepsilon^i (\mathbf{e}_j) = \delta_j^i = \begin{cases} 1,\quad& i = j \\ 0,\quad& i \neq j \end{cases}
$$

Then $(\varepsilon^i)$ is a basis for $V^*$, called the *dual basis* to $(\mathbf{e}_j)$. Thus, $\dim(V^*) = \dim(V)$
</MathBox>

In general, if $(\mathbf{e}_j)$ is a basis for $V$ and $(\varepsilon^i)$ is its dual basis, then for any vector $\mathbf{v} = v^j \mathbf{e}_j \in V$ we have

$$
  \varepsilon^i (\mathbf{v}) = v^j \varepsilon^i (\mathbf{e}_j) = v^j \delta_j^i = v^i
$$

In terms of the dual basis, any covector can be expressed as $\omega = \omega(\mathbf{e}_i) \varepsilon^i = \omega_i \varepsilon^i$. The action of $\omega$ on a vector $\mathbf{v}$ is

$$
  \omega(\mathbf{v}) = \omega_i \varepsilon^i (\mathbf{v}) = \omega_i v^i
$$

<MathBox title='Transpose' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $V$ and $W$ are vector spaces, and $A:V\to W$ is a linear map. The *transpose* (dual map) of $A$, is a map $A^* : W^* \to V^*$ defined by

$$
  (A^* \omega)(\mathbf{v}) = \omega(A\mathbf{v}),\; \omega\in W^*, \mathbf{v}\in V
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of the transpose' boxType='proposition'>

The assignment that sends a vector space to its dual space and a linear map to its dual map is a contravariant functor from the category of real vector spaces to itself.

<MathBox title='Second dual space' boxType='definition'>
Let $V$ be a real vector space. The *second dual space* of $V$, denoted $V^{**} = (V^*)^{*}$ is characterized by a basis-independent map $\xi: V\to V^{**}$ defined as follows. For each vector $\mathbf{v}\in V$, define a linear functional $\xi(\mathbf{v}): V^* \to\R$ by

$$
  \xi(\mathbf{v})(\omega) = \omega(\mathbf{v}),\; \omega\in V^*
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Vector dual space isomorphism' boxType='proposition'>
For any finite-dimensional real vector space $V$, the map $\xi: V\to V^{**}$ is an isomorphism.

<details>

Because $\dim(V) = \dim(V^{**})$, it suffices to verify that $\xi$ is injective. Suppose that $\mathbf{v}\in V$ is not zero. Extend $\mathbf{v}$ to a basis $(\mathbf{v} = (\mathbf{e}_1,\dots,\mathbf{e}_n)$ for $V$, and lett $(\varepsilon)_{i=1}^n$ denote the dual basis for $V^*$. Then $\xi(\mathbf{v}) \neq 0$ because

$$
  \xi(\mathbf{v})(\varepsilon^1) = \varepsilon^1(\mathbf{v}) = \varepsilon^1 (\mathbf{e}_1) = 1

## Tangent covectors on manifolds

<MathBox title='Cotangent space' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the *cotangent space* at $\mathbf{p}$, denoted by $T_\mathbf{p}^* M$, is defined as the dual space to $T_\mathbf{p}M$

$$
  T_\mathbf{p}^* M = (T_\mathbf{p} M)^*
$$

Elements of $T_\mathbf{p}^* M$ are called *tangent covectors* at $\mathbf{p}$.
</MathBox>

Given smooth local coordinates $(x^i)$ on an open subset $U\subseteq M$, for each $\mathbf{p}\in U$ for coordinate basis $\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \right|_\mathbf{p} \right)$ gives rise to a dual basis for $T_\mathbf{p}^* M$, denoted for the moment by $(\lambda^i|_\mathbf{p})$. Any covector $\omega\in T_\mathbf{p}^* M$ can thus be written uniquely as $\omega = \omega_i \lambda^i |_\mathbf{p}$, where

$$
  \omega_i = \omega\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p}\right)
$$

Suppose that $(\tilde{x}^j)$ is another set of smooth coordinates whose domain contains $\mathbf{p}$, and let $(\tilde{\lambda}^i |_\mathbf{p})$ denote the basis for $T_\mathbf{p}^* M$ dual to $\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{x}^i} \right|_\mathbf{p} \right)$. Note that the coordinate vector fields transform as follows

$$
  \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} = \frac{\partial \tilde{x}^j}{\partial x^i} (\mathbf{p}) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial\tilde{x}^j}\right|_\mathbf{p}
$$

Writing $\omega$ in both systems as $\omega = \omega_i \lambda^i |_\mathbf{p} = \tilde{\omega}_j \tilde{\lambda}^j |_\mathbf{p}$, we can use the coordinate transformation to compute $\omega_i$ in terms of $\tilde{\omega}_j$:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \omega_i =& \omega\left( \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} \right) \\
  =& \omega\left( \frac{\partial\tilde{x}^j}{\partial x^i} (\mathbf{p}) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial\tilde{x}^j}\right|_\mathbf{p} \right) \\
  =& \frac{\partial\tilde{x}^j}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p})\tilde{\omega}_j
\end{align*}
$$

It is customary to call tangent covectors *covariant vectors* because their components transform in the same way as the coordinate partial derivatives, with the Jacobian matrix $\left(\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^j}{\partial x^i} \right)$ multiplying the objects associated with the transformed coordinates $(\tilde{x}^j)$ to obtain the original coordinates $(x^i)$. Analogously, tangent vectors are called *contravariant vectors* because their components transform in the opposite way.

## Covector fields

<MathBox title='Cotangent bundle' boxType='definition'>
For any smooth $n$-manifold $M$ with or without boundary, the disjoint union

$$
  T^* M = \bigsqcup_{\mathbf{p}\in M} T_\mathbf{p}^* M
$$

is the *cotangent bundle* of $M$. It has a natural projection map $\pi: T^* M \to M$ sending $\omega\in T_\mathbf{p}^* M$ to $\mathbf{p}\in M$. Given any smooth local coordinates $(x^i)$ on an open subset $U\subseteq M$, for each $\mathbf{p}\in U$ we denote the basis for $T_\mathbf{p}^* M$ dual to $\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p}\right)$ by $(\lambda^i |_\mathbf{p})$. This defines $n$ maps $\lambda_i,\dots,\lambda^n:U\to T^* M$, called *coordinate covector fields*.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='The cotangent bundle as a vector bundle' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary. With its standard projection map and the natural vector space structure on each fiber, the cotangent bundle $T^* M$ has a unique topology and smooth structure making it not a smooth rank-$n$ vector bundle over $M$, for which all coordinate covector field are smooth local sections.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The proof is analogous to the proof for the corresponding proposition for tangent bundles. Given a smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ on $M$, with coordinate functions $(x^i)$, define $\Phi:\pi^{-1}(U) \to U\times\R^n$ by

$$
  \Phi(\xi_i \lambda^i |_\mathbf{p}) = (\mathbf{p}, (\xi_1,\dots,\xi_n))
$$

where $\lambda^i$ is the $i$th coordinate covector field associated with $(x^i)$. Suppose that $(\tilde{U}, \tilde{\varphi})$ is another smooth chart with coordinate functions $(\tilde{x}^j)$, and let $\tilde{\Phi}: \pi^{-1}(\tilde{U}\to \tilde{U}\times\R^n$ be defined analogously. On $\pi^{-1}(U\cap\tilde{U})$, it follows from the covector transformation law that

$$
  \Phi\circ\tilde{\Phi}^{-1}(\mathbf{p}, (\tilde{\xi}_1,\dots,\tilde{\xi}_n)) = \left(\mathbf{p}, \left( \frac{\partial\tilde{x}^j}{\partial x^1}(\mathbf{p})\tilde{\xi}_j,\dots, \frac{\partial\tilde{x}^j}{\partial x^n}(\mathbf{p}) \tilde{\xi}_j \right) \right)
$$

The $\mathrm{GL}(n,\R)$-valued function $\left(\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^j}{\partial x^i} \right)$ is smooth, so it follows from the vector bundle chart lemma that $T^* M$ has a smooth structure making it into a smooth vector bundle for which the maps $\Phi$ are smooth local trivialization. Uniqueness follows as in the corresponding proposition for tangent bundles.
</details>
</MathBox>

As in the case of the tangent bundle, smooth local coordinates for a smooth $n$-manifold $M$ yield smooth local coordinates for its cotangent bundle. If $(x^i)$ are smooth coordinates on an open subset $U\subseteq M$, then the map from $\pi^{-1}(U)$ to $\R^{2n}$ given bY

$$
  \xi_i \lambda^i |_\mathbf{p} \mapsto (x^1(\mathbf{p}), \dots, x^n (\mathbf{p}), \xi_1, \dots, \xi_n)
$$

is a smooth coordinate chart for $T^* M$. We call $(x^i, \xi_i)$ the *natural coordinates* for $T^* M$ associated with $(x^i)$. 

A (local or global) section of $T^* M$ is called a *covector field* or a *(differential) 1-form*. Like sections of other bundles, covector fields without further qualification are assumed to be merely continuous. Otherwise, we use the terms *rough covector field* and *smooth vector field* with obvious meanings. In any smooth local coordinates on an open subset $U\subseteq M$, a (rough) covector field $\omega$ can be written in terms of the coordinate covector fields $(\lambda^i)$ as $\omega = \omega_i \lambda^i$ for $n$ functions $\omega_i:U\to\R$ called the *component functions* of $\omega$. They are characterized by

$$
  \omega_i (\mathbf{p}) = \omega_\mathbf{p}\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p}\right)
$$

If $\omega$ is a (rough) covector field and $X$ is a vector field on $M$, then we can form a function $\omega(X):M\to\R$ by

$$
  \omega(X)(\mathbf{p}) = \omega_\mathbf{p}(X_\mathbf{p}),\quad \mathbf{p}\in M
$$

Writing $\omega = \omega_i \lambda^i$ and $X = X^j \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}$ in terms of local coordinates, then $\omega(X)$ has the local coordinate representation $\omega(X) = \omega_i X^i$.

<MathBox title='Smoothness criteria for covector fields' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and let $\omega: M\to T^* M$ be a rough covector field. The following are equivalent:
1. $\omega$ is smooth
2. in every smooth coordinate chart, the component functions of $\omega$ are smooth
3. each point of $M$ is contained in some coordinate chart in which $\omega$ has smooth component functions
4. for every smooth vector field $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$, the function $\omega(X)$ is smooth on $M$
5. for every open subset $U\subseteq M$ and every smooth vector field $X$ on $U$, the function $\omega(X):U\to\R$ is smooth on $U$
</MathBox>

## Coframes

<MathBox title='Local and global coframe' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and let $U\subseteq M$ be an open subset. A *local coframe* for $M$ over $U$ is an ordered $n$-tuple of covector fields $(\varepsilon^1, \dots, \varepsilon^n)$ defined on $U$ such that $(\varepsilon^i |_\mathbf{p})$ forms a basis for $T_\mathbf{p}^* M$ at each point $\mathbf{p}\in U$. If $U = M$, it is called a *global coframe*.
</MathBox>

For any smooth chart $(U, (x^i))$, to coordinate covector fields $(\lambda^i)$ defined above constitute a local coframe over $U$, called a *coordinate coframe*. By the smoothness criteria for covector fields, every coordinate frame is smooth, because its component functions in the given chart are constants.

Given a local frame $(E_1,\dots,E_n)$ for $TM$ over an open subset $U\subseteq M$, there is a uniquely determined (rough) local coframe $(\varepsilon^1,\dots,\varepsilon^n)$ over $U$ such that $(\varepsilon^i |_\mathbf{p})$ is the dual basis to $(E_i |_\mathbf{p})$ for each $\mathbf{p}\in U$, or equivalently $\varepsilon^i (E_j) = \delta_j^i$. This is called the *coframe* dual to $(E_i)$. Conversely, if we start with a local coframe $(\varepsilon^i)$ over an open subset $U\subseteq M$, there is a uniquely determined local frame $(E_i)$ called the *frame dual* to $(\varepsilon^i)$, determined by $\varepsilon^i (E_j) = \delta_j^i$.

<MathBox title='' boxType='lemma'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. If $(E_i)$ is a rough local frame over an open subset $U\subseteq M$ and $(\varepsilon^i)$ is its dual coframe, then $(E_i)$ is smooth if and only if $(\varepsilon^i)$ is smooth.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

It suffices to show that for each $\mathbf{p}\in U$, the frame $(E_i)$ is smooth in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ if and only if $(\varepsilon^i)$ is. Given $\mathbf{p}\in U$, let $(V,(x^i))$ be a smooth coordinate chart such that $\mathbf{p}\in V\subseteq U$. In $V$, we can write

$$
\begin{align*}
  E_i =& a_i^k \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k} \\
  \varepsilon^j =& b_l^j \lambda^l
\end{align*}
$$

for some matrices of real-valued functions $(a_i^k)$ and $(b_l^j)$ defined on $V$. By the smoothness criteria, the vector fields $E_i$ are smooth on $V$ if and only if the functions $a_i^k$ are smooth, and the covector fields $\varepsilon^j$ are smooth on $V$ if and only if the function $b_l^j$ are smooth. The fact that $\varepsilon^j (E_i) = \delta_i^j$ implies that the matrices $(a_i^k)$ and $(b_l^j)$ are inverses of each other. Because matrix inversion is a smooth map from $\mathrm{GL}(n,\R)$ to itself, either one theses matrix-valued functions is smooth if and only if the other one is smooth.
</details>
</MathBox>

Given a local coframe $(\varepsilon^i)$ over an open subset $U\subseteq M$, every (rough) covector field $\omega$ on $U$ can be expressed in terms of the coframes as $\omega = \omega_i \varepsilon^i$ for some functions $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_n:U\to\R$, called the component functions of $\omega$ with respect to the given coframe. The component functions are determined by $\omega_i = \omega(E_i)$, where $E_i$ is the frame dual to $(\varepsilon^i)$.

<MathBox title='Coframe criterion for smoothness of covector fields' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and let $\omega$ be a rough covector field on $M$. If $(\varepsilon^i)$ is a smooth coframe on an open subset $U\subseteq M$, then $\omega$ is smooth on $U$ if and only if its component functions with respect to $(\varepsilon^i)$ are smooth.
</MathBox>

The real vector space of all smooth covector fields on a manifold $M$ is denoted by $\mathfrak{X}^* (M)$. As smooth sections of a vector bundle, elements of $\mathfrak{X}^* (M)$ can be multiplied by smooth real-valued functions: if $f\in C^\infty(M)$ and $\omega\in \mathfrak{X}^* (M)$, the covector field $f\omega$ is defined by

$$
  (f\omega)_\mathbf{p} = f(\mathbf{p})\omega_\mathbf{p}
$$

Because it is the space of smooth sections of a vector bundle, $\mathfrak{X}^* (M)$ is a module over $C^\infty (M)$.

A geometric picture of a coverfor field can be established from the fact that a nonzero linear functional $\omega_\mathbf{p}\in T_\mathbf{p}^* M$ is completely determined by two sets: its kernel, which is a linear hyperplane in $T_\mathbf{p}$ (a codimension-$1$ linear subspace), and the set of vectors $\Set{\mathbf{v} \in T_\mathbf{p} M | \omega_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}) = 1}$, which is an affine hyperplane parallel to the kernel. The value $\omega_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v})$ for any other vector $\mathbf{v}$ is then obtained by linear interpolation or extrapolation. 

Thus, you can visualize a covector field as defining a pair of hyperplanes in each tangent space, one through the origin and another parallel to it, and varying continuously from point to point. Where the covector field is small, one of the hyperplanes becomes very far from the kernel, eventuall disappearing altogether at points where the covector field takes the value zero.

## The differential of a function

<MathBox title='Differential' boxType='definition'>
Let $f \in C^\infty (M)$ be a smooth real-valued function on a smooth manifold $M$ with or without boundary. The *differential* of $f$ is a covector $\mathrm{d}f$ defined bY

$$
  \mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p} := \mathbf{v}f,\; \mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p} M
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
The differential of a smooth function is a smooth covector field.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

It is straightforward to verify that at each point $\mathbf{p}\in M$, then $\mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v})$ depends linearly on $\mathbf{v}$, so that $\mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p}$ is indeed a covector at $\mathbf{p}$. To see that $\mathrm{d}f$ is smooth, we apply the smoothness criteria for covector fields: for any smooth vector field $X$ on $M$, the function $\mathrm{d}f(X)$ is smooth because it is equal to $Xf$.
</details>
</MathBox>

Let $f\in C^\infty (M)$ be a smooth real-value function on a smooth manifold $M$ with or without boundary. To compute the coordinate representation of a differential $\mathrm{d}f$, consider the smooth coordinates $(x^i)$ on an open subset $U\subseteq M$. Let $(\lambda^i)$ be the corresponding coordinate coframes on $U$. Write $\mathrm{d}f$ in coordinates as $\mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p} = A_i (\mathbf{p})\lambda^i |_\mathbf{p}$ for some functions $A_i:U\to\R$. Then the definition of $\mathrm{d}f$ implies

$$
\begin{align*}
  A_i (\mathbf{p}) =& \mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p} \left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} \right) \\
  =& \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} f \\
  =& \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p})
\end{align*}
$$

The yields the following formula for the coordinate representation of $\mathrm{d}f$

$$
  \mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p})\lambda^i |_\mathbf{p}
$$

Thus, the component functions of $\mathrm{d}f$ in any smooth coordinate chart are the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to those coordinates. Because of this, we can think of $\mathrm{d}f$ as an analogue of the classical gradient.

If $f$ is one of the coordinate functions we get that

$$
  \mathrm{d}x^j |_\mathbf{p} = \frac{\partial x^j}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p})\lambda^i |_\mathbf{p} = \delta_i^j \lambda^i|_\mathbf{p} = \lambda^j|_\mathbf{p}
$$

The formula for $\mathrm{d}f$ can thus be rewritten as

$$
  \mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p})\mathrm{d}x^i |_\mathbf{p}
$$

or as an equation between covector fields instead of vectors

$$
  \mathrm{d}f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial f}\mathrm{d}x_i
$$

Particularly, in the $1$-dimensional case, this resduces to

$$
  \mathrm{d}f = \frac{\mathrm{d f}}{\mathrm{d}x}\mathrm{d}x
$$

<MathBox title='Properties of the differential' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and let $f,g\in C^\infty (M)$.
1. $\mathrm{d}(\alpha f + \beta g)$ for $\alpha, \beta\in\R$
2. $\mathrm{d}(fg) = f\mathrm{d}g + g\mathrm{d}f$
3. $\mathrm{d}\left(\frac{f}{g}\right) = \frac{g\mathrm{d}f - f \mathrm{d}g}{g^2}$ where $g\neq 0$
4. if $J\subseteq\R$ is an interval containing the image of $f$, and $h:J\to\R$ is a smooth function, then $d(h\circ f) = (h' \circ f)\mathrm{d}f$

<MathBox title='Functions with vanishing differentials' boxType='proposition'>
If $f$ is a smooth real-valued function on a smooth manifold $M$ with or without boundary, then $\mathrm{d}f = 0$ if and only if $f$ is constant on each component of $M$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

It suffices to assume that $M$ is connected and show that $\mathrm{d}f = 0$ if and only if $f$ is constant. One direction is immediately: if $f$ is constant, then $\mathrm{d}f = 0$ by properties of the differential. Conversely, suppose that $\mathrm{d}f = 0$, let $\mathbf{p}\in M$ and let $\mathcal{C} = \Set{\mathbf{q} \in M: f(\mathbf{q}) = f(\mathbf{p})}$. If $\mathbf{q}$ is any point in $\mathcal{C}$, let $U$ be a smooth coordinate ball (or half-ball if $\mathbf{q}\in\partial M$) centered at $\mathbf{q}$. From $\mathrm{d}f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial f}\mathrm{d}x_i$, we see that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \equiv 0$ in $U$ for each $i$, so by elementary calculus, $f$ is constant on $U$. This shows that $\mathcal{C}$ is open, and since it is closed by continuity, it must be all of $M$. Thus, $f$ is everywhere equal to the constant $f(\mathbf{p})$.
</details>
</MathBox>

Suppose that $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold. By choosing smooth coordinates on a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}\in M$, we can think of $f\in C^\infty (M)$ as a function on an open subset $U\subseteq\R^n$. Recall that $\mathrm{d}x^i |_\mathbf{p}$ is the linear functional that picks out the $i$th component of a tangent vector at $\mathbf{p}$. Writing $\Delta f = f(\mathbf{p}+ \mathbf{v}) - f(\mathbf{p})$ for $\mathbf{v}\in\R^n$, Taylor's theorem shows that $\Delta f$ is well approximated for small $\mathrm{v}$ by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \Delta \approx& \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p})v^i \\
  =& \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p})\mathrm{d}x^i|_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}) = \mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v})
\end{align*}
$$

where we are now considering $\mathbf{v}$ as an element of $T_\mathbf{p}\R^n$ via the isomorphism $T_\mathbf{p}\R^n \cong \R^n$. In other words, $\mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p}$ is the linear functional that best approximates $\Delta f$ near $\mathbf{p}$

<MathBox title='Derivative of a function along a curve' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, $\gamma: J\subseteq\R \to M$ is a smooth curve, and $f:M\to\R$ is a smooth function. Then the derivative of the real-valued function $f\circ\gamma: J\to\R$ is given by

$$
  (f\circ\gamma)'(t) = \mathrm{d}f_{\gamma(t)}(\gamma'(t))
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

It follows directly from the definition that for any $t_0 \in J$

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}f_{\gamma(t_0)} (\gamma'(t_0)) =& \gamma'(t_0)f \\
  =& \mathrm{d}\gamma_{t_0} \left(\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t_0} \right)f \\
  =& \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t_0} (f\circ\gamma) \\
  =& (f\circ\gamma)'(t_0)
\end{align*}

## Pullbacks of covector fields

<MathBox title='Pullbacks' boxType='definition'>
Let $F:M\to N$ be a smooth map between smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and let $\mathbf{p}\in M$ be arbitrary. The differential $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p} M \to T_{F(\mathbf{p})} N$ yields a dual linear map

$$
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}^* : T_{F(\mathbf{p})}^* N \to T_\mathbf{p}^* M
$$

called the *(pointwise) pullback* by $F$ at $\mathbf{p}$, or the *cotangent map* of $F$. Unraveling the definitions, we see that $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}^*$ is characterized by

$$
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}^* (\omega)(\mathbf{v}) = \omega(\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v})),\; \omega\in T_{F(\mathbf{p})}^* N, \mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p}M
$$

If $\omega$ is a covector field in $M$, we define a rough vector field $F^* \omega$ on $M$, called the *pullback* of $\omega$ by $F$ by

$$
  (F^*\omega)_\mathbf{p} = \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}^* (\omega_{F(\mathbf{p})})
$$

It acts on a vector $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p}M$ by

$$
  (F^*\omega)_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v}) = \omega_{F(\mathbf{p})} (\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}))
$$
</MathBox>

Observe that the assignments $(M,\mathbf{p})\mapsto T_\mathbf{p}^* M$ and $F\mapsto \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}^*$ yields a contravariant functor from the category of pointed smooth manifolds to the category of real vector spaces. This shows that the convention of calling covectors in $T^* M$ *covariant* is particularly unfortunate.

  (F^*(u\omega))_\mathbf{p} =& \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}^* ((u\omega)_{F(\mathbf{p})}) \\

Suppose that $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map between smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and let $\omega$ be a covector field on $N$. Then $F^* \omega$ is a (continuous) covector field on $M$. If $\omega$ is smooth, then so is $F^* \omega$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\mathbf{p}\in M$ be arbitrary, and choose smooth coordinates (y^j) for $N$ in a neighbourhood $V$ of $F(\mathbf{p})$. Let $U = F^{-1}(V)$, which is a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$. Writing $\omega$ in coordinates as $\omega = \omega_j \mathrm{d}y^j$ for continuous functions $\omega_j$ on $V$ and using the previous proposition twice (applied to $F|_U$),, we have the following computation in $U$

$$
\begin{align*}
  F^* \omega =& F^* (\omega_j \mathrm{d}y^j) (\omega_j \circ F)F^* \mathrm{d}y^j \\
  =& (\omega_j \circ F)\mathrm{d}(y^j \circ F)
\end{align*}
$$

This expression is continuous, and is smooth if $\omega$ is smooth.

The pullback formula for a covector field can also be written As

$$
  F^* \omega = (\omega_j \circ F)\mathrm{d}(y^i \circ F) = (\omega_j \circ F)\mathrm{d}F^j
$$

where $F^j$ is the $j$th component function of $F$ in these coordinates.

### Restricting covector fields to submanifolds

Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, $S\subseteq M$ is an immersed submanifold with or without boundary, and $\iota: S\hookrightarrow M$ is the inclusion map. If $\omega$ is any smooth covector field on $M$, the pullback by $\iota$ yields a smooth covector field $\iota^*\omega$ on $S$. To see what this means, let $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p} S$ be arbitrary, and compute

$$
  (\iota^* \omega)_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v}) = \omega_\mathbf{p} (\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v})) = \omega_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v})
$$

sinde $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p}S \to T_\mathbf{p}M$ is just the inclusion map, under our usual identificaion of $T_\mathbf{p} S$ with a subspace of $T_\mathbf{p} M$. Thus, $\iota^* \omega$ is just the restriction of $\omega$ to vectors tangent to $S$. For this reason $\iota^* \omega$ is often called the *restriction* of $\omega$ to $S$. Note that $\iota^* \omega$ might equal zero at a given point of $S$, although considered as covector field on $M$, $\omega$ migth not vanish there.

To distinguish the two ways in which we might interpret the statement "$\omega$ vanishes on $S$", one usually says that $\omega$ *vanishes along* $S$ or *vanishes at points* of $S$ if $\omega_\mathbf{p} = 0$ for for every point $\mathbf{p}\in S$. The weaker condition that $\iota^* \omega = 0$ is expressed by saying that the restriction of $\omega$ to $S$ vanishes, or the pullback of $\omega$ to $S$ vanishes.

## Line integrals

<MathBox title='Integral of covector fields' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $[a,b]\subseteq\R$ is a compact interval, and that $\omega$ is a smooth covector field on $[a,b]$. This means that the component function of $\omega$ admits a smooth extension to some neighbourhood of $[a,b]$. If we let $t$ denote the standard coordinate on $\R$, we can write $\omega$ as $\omega_t = f(t)\mathrm{d}t$ for some smooth function $f:[a,b]\to\R$. The integral of $\omega$ over $[a,b]$ is defined as

$$
  \int_{[a,b]} \omega = \int_a^b f(t)\;\mathbf{d}t
$$

<MathBox title='Diffeomorphism invariance of the integral' boxType='proposition'>
Let $\omega$ be a smooth covector field on the compact interval $[a,b]\subseteq\R$. If $\varphi:[c,d] \to [a,b]$ is an increasing diffeomorphism, i.e. $t_1 < t_2 \implies \varphi(t_1) < \varphi(t_2)$, then

$$
  \int_{[c,d]} \varphi^* \omega = \int_{[a,b]} \omega
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If we let $s$ denote the standard coordinate on $[c,d]$ and $t$ on $[a,b]$, then the pullback formula shows that the pullback $\varphi^* \omega$ has the coordinate expression $(\varphi^* \omega)_s = f(\varphi(s))\varphi'(s)\mathrm{d}s$. Inserting this into the definition of the line integral and using the change of variables formula for ordinary integrals, we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
  \int_{[c,d]} \varphi^* \omega =& \int_c^d f(\varphi(s))\varphi'(s)\;\mathrm{d}s \\
  =& \int_a^b f(t)\;\mathrm{d}t = \int_{[a,b]}\omega

<MathBox title='Curve segment' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. A *curve segment* in $M$ is a continuous curve $\gamma:[a,b] \to M$ whose domain is a compact interval. It is a *smooth curve segment* if it is smooth $[a,b]$ is considered as a manifold with boundary (or, equivalently, if $\gamma$ has an extension to a smooth curve defined in a neighbourhood of each endpoint). It is a *piecewise smooth curve segment* if there exists a finite partition $a = a_0 < a_1 < \cdots < a_k = b$ of $[a,b]$ such that $\gamma|_{[a_{i-1}, a_i]}$ is smooth for each $i$. If $\gamma(a) = \gamma(b)$, then $\gamma$ is a *closed curve segment*.

Continuity of $\gamma$ means that $\gamma(t)$ approaches the same value as $t$ approaches any of the points $a_i$ (other than $a_0$ or $a_k$) from the left or the right. Smoothness of $\gamma$ on each subinterval means that $\gamma$ has one-sided velocity vectors at each such $a_i$ when approaching from the left of the right, but these one-sided velocities need not be equal.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
If $M$ is a connected smooth manifold with or without boundary, any two points of $M$ can be joined by a piecewise smooth curve segment.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\mathbf{p}\in M$ be arbitrary, and define a subset $\mathcal{C}\subseteq M$ by

$$
  \mathcal{C} = \Set{\mathbf{q}\in M | \text{there is a piecewise smooth curve segment in } M \text{ from } \mathbf{p} \text{ to } \mathbf{q}}
$$

Clearly, $\mathbf{p}\in \mathcal{C}$, so $\mathcal{C}$ is nonempty. To show that $\mathcal{C} = M$, we need to show that it is open and closed in $M$.

Let $\mathbf{q}\in\mathcal{C}$ be arbitrary, which means that there is a piecewise smooth curve segment $\gamma$ going from $\mathbf{p}$ to $\mathbf{q}$. Let $U$ be a smooth coordinate ball (or half-ball) centered at $\mathbf{q}$. If $\mathbf{q}'$ is any point in $U$, then it is easy to construct a piecewise smooth curve segment from $\mathbf{p}$ to $\mathbf{q}'$ by first following $\gamma$ from $\mathbf{p}$ to $\mathbf{q}$, and then following a straight-line path in coordinates from $\mathbf{q}$ to $\mathbf{q}'$. Thus $U\subseteq\mathcal{C}$, which shows that $\mathbf{C}$ is open in $M$.

On the other hand, if $\mathbf{q}\in \partial\mathcal{C}$, let $U$ be a smooth coordinate ball or half-ball around $\mathbf{q}$ as above. The fact that $\mathbf{q}$ is a boundary point of $\mathcal{C}$ means that there is some point $\mathbf{q}'\in \mathcal{C}\cap U$. In this case, we can construct a piecewise smooth curve from $\mathbf{p}$ to $\mathbf{q}$ by first following one from $\mathbf{p}$ to $\mathbf{q}'$ and then following a straight-line path in coordinates from $\mathbf{q}$ to $\mathbf{q}'$. This shows that $\mathbf{q}\in\mathcal{C}$, so $\mathcal{C}$ is also closed.

<MathBox title='Line integral' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $M$ is smooth manifold with or without boundary. If $\gamma:[a,b]\to M$ is a smooth curve segment and $\omega$ is a smooth covector field on $M$, we define the *line integral* of $\omega$ over $\gamma$ to be the real number

$$
  \int_\gamma \omega = \int_[a,b] \gamma^* \omega
$$

Because, $\gamma^* \omega$ is a smooth covector field on $[a,b]$, this definition makes sense. More generally, if $\gamma$ is piecewise smooth, we define

$$
  \int_\gamma \omega = \sum_{i=1}^k \int_{[a_{i-1}, a_i]} \gamma^* \omega

<MathBox title='Reparametrization' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary.

First assume that $\gamma:[a,b]\to M$ is smooth, and suppose that $\tilde{\gamma} = \gamma\circ\varphi$, where $\varphi:[c,d]\to [a,b]$ is an increasing diffeomorphism. Then the diffeomorphism invariance implies

$$
\begin{align*}
  \int_\tilde{\gamma} \omega =& \int_{[c,d]} (\gamma\circ\varphi)^* \omega \\
  =& \int_{[c,d]} \varphi^* \gamma^* \omega = \int_{[a,b]} \gamma^* \omega \\
  =& \int_\gamma \omega

$$

The proof for when $\varphi$ is decreasing is analogous.

If $\gamma$ is only piecewise smooth, the result follows simply by applying the preceding argument on each subinterval where $\gamma$ is smooth.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary. If $\gamma:[a,b]\to M$ is a piecewise smooth curve segment, the line integral of $\omega$ over $\gamma$ can also be expressed as the ordinary integral

$$
  \int_\gamma \omega = \int_a^b \omega_{\gamma(t)} (\gamma' (t))\;\mathrm{d}t
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Fir suppose that $\gamma$ is smooth and that its image is contained in the domain of a single smooth chart. Writing the coordinate representations of $\gamma$ and $\omega$ as $(\gamma^i(t))_{i=1}^n$ and $\omega_i \mathrm{d}x^i$, respectively, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \omega_{\gamma(t)} (\gamma'(t)) =& \omega_i (\gamma(t))\mathrm{d}x^i (\gamma'(t)) \\
  =& \omega_i (\gamma(t))\dot{\gamma}^i (t)
\end{align*}
$$

Combining this with the pullback formula for covector fields, we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
  (\gamma^* \omega)_t =& (\omega_i \circ\gamma)(t)\mathrm{d}(\gamma^i)_t \\
  =& \omega_i (\gamma(t))\dot{\gamma}^i (t)\mathrm{d}t \\
  =& \omega_{\gamma(t)}(\gamma'(t))\mathrm{d}t

Thus, by the definition of the line integral

$$
  \int_\gamma \omega = \int_{[a,b]} \gamma^* \omega = \int_a^b \omega_{\gamma(t)} (\gamma'(t))\mathrm{d}t
$$

If $\gamma$ is an arbitrary smooth curve segment, by compactness there exists a finite partition $a = a_0 < a_1 < \cdots < a_k = b$ of $[a,b]$ such that $\gamma([a_{i-1}, a_i])$ is contained in the domain of a single smooth chart for each $i=1,\dots,k$, so we can apply the computation above on each such subinterval.

By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this is equal to $f\circ\gamma(b) - f\circ\gamma(a)$.

If $\gamma$ is merely piecewise smooth, let $a = a_0 < a_1 < \cdots < a_k = b$ be the endpoints of the subintervals on which $\gamma$ is smooth. Applying the above argument on each subinterval and summing, we find that

$$

## Conservative covector fields

<MathBox title='Exact differential and potential' boxType='definition'>
A smooth covector field $\omega$ on a smooth manifold $M$ with or without boundary is an *exact differential* on $M$ if there is a function $f\in C^\infty(M)$ such that $\omega = \mathrm{d}f$. In this case, the function $f$ is called a *potential* for $\omega$. The potential is not uniquely determined, but by properties of the line integral, difference between any two potentials for $\omega$ must be constant on each component of $M$. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Conservative vector field' boxType='definition'>
A smooth covector field $\omega$ on a smooth manifold $M$ with or without boundary is *conservative* if the line integral of $\omega$ for every piecewise smooth closed curve segment is zero.

<details>

This terminology comes from physics, where a force field is called conservative if the change in energy caused by the force acting along any closed path is zero, meaning that energy is conserved.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
A smooth covector field $\omega$ is conservative if and only if its line integrals are path-independent, in the sense that $\int_\gamma \omega = \int_{\tilde{\gamma}}\omega$ whenever $\gamma$ and $\tilde{\gamma}$ are piecewise smooth curve segments with the same starting and ending points.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='theorem'>
Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary. A smooth covector field on $M$ is conservative if and only if it is exact.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $\omega\in\mathfrak{X}^* (M)$ is exact, the fundamental theorem for line integrals shows that it is conservative, so we need only to prove the converse. Suppose that $\omega$ is conservative, and assume for the moment that $M$ is connected. Because the line integrals of $\omega$ are path-independent, we can adopt the following notation: for any points $\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}\in M$, we use the notation $\int_\mathbf{p}^\mathbf{q} \omega$ to denote the value of any integral of the form $\int_\gamma \omega$, where $\gamma$ is a piecewise smooth curve segment from $\mathbf{p}$ to $\mathbf{q}$. Because a backward representation of a path from $\mathbf{p}$ to $\mathbf{q}$ is path from $\mathbf{q}$ to $\mathbf{p}$, then by parameter independence it follows that $\int_\mathbf{q}^\mathbf{p} \omega = -\int_\mathbf{p}^\mathbf{q \omega}$. For any three points $\mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2, \mathbf{p}_3\in M$, then by properties of the line integral

$$
  \int_{\mathbf{p}_1}^{\mathbf{p}_2} \omega + \int_{\mathbf{p}_2}^{\mathbf{p}_3} \omega = \int_{\mathbf{p}_1}^{\mathbf{p}_3} \omega
$$

Choose any base point $\mathbf{p}_0 \in M$, and define a function $f:M\to\R$ by $f(\mathbf{q}) = \int_{\mathbf{p}_0}^\mathbf{q} \omega$. We need to show that $f$ is smooth and $\mathrm{d}f = \omega$. To accomplish this, let $\mathbf{q}_0 \in M$ be arbitrary, let $(U, (x^i))$ be a smooth chart centered at $\mathbf{q}_0$, and write the coordinate representation of $\omega$ in $U$ as $\omega = \omega_i \mathrm{d}x^i$. We need to show that

$$
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^j} (\mathbf{q}_0) = \omega_j (\mathbf{q}_0),\; j=1,\dots,\n
$$

which implies that $\mathrm{d}f_{\mathbf{q}_0} = \omega_{\mathbf{q}_0}$.

First suppose that $\mathbf{q}_0 \in \mathrm{int}(M)$. Fix $j$, and let $\gamma:[-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]\to U$ be the smooth curve segment defined in coordinates by $\gamma(t) = (0,\dots,t,\dots,0)$ with $t$ in the $j$th place, and with $\varepsilon$ chose small enough that $\gamma[-\varepsilon, \varepsilon]\subseteq U$. Let $\mathbf{p}_1 = \gamma(-\varepsilon)$, and define a new function $\tilde{f}: M\to \R$ by $\tilde{f}(\mathbf{q}) = \int_{\mathbf{p}_1}^\mathbf{q} \omega$. Then

$$
\begin{align*}
  f(\mathbf{q}) - \tilde{f}(\mathbf{q}) =& \int_{\mathbf{p}_0}^\mathbf{q} \omega - \int_{\mathbf{p}_1}^\mathbf{q} \omega \\
  =& \int_{\mathbf{p}_0}^\mathbf{q} \omega + \int_\mathbf{q}^{\mathbf{p}_1} \omega \\
  =& \int_{\mathbf{p}_0}^{\mathbf{p}_1} \omega
\end{align*}
$$

which does not depend on $\mathbf{q}$. Thus $\tilde{f}$ and $f$ differ by a constant, so it suffices to show that $\frac{\partial\tilde{f}}{\partial x^j}(\mathbf{q_0}) = \omega_j (\mathbf{q}_0)$.

Now $\gamma'(t) = \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\right|_{\gamma(t)}$ by construction, so

$$
\begin{align*}
  \omega_{\gamma(t)}(\gamma'(t)) =& \omega_i (\gamma(t))\mathrm{d}x^i \left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\right|_{\gamma(t)} \right) = \gamma_j (\gamma(t))
\end{align*}
$$

Since the restriction of $\gamma$ to $[-\epsilon, t]$ is a smooth curve from $\mathbf{p}_1$ to $\gamma(t)$ we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{f}\circ\gamma(t) =& \int_{\mathbf{p}_1}^{\gamma(t)} \omega = \int_{-\varepsilon}^t \omega_{\gamma(s)}(\gamma'(s))\;\mathrm{d}s \\
  =& \int_{-\varepsilon}^t \omega_j (\gamma(s))\;\mathrm{d}s
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, by the fundamental theorem of calculus

$$
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial\tilde{f}}{\partial x^j} (\mathbf{q}_0) =& \gamma'(0)\tilde{f} = \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}_{t=0} \tilde{f}\circ\gamma(t) \\
  =& \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}_{t=0} \int_{-\varepsilon}^t \omega_j (\gamma(s))\;\mathrm{d}s \\
  =& \omega_j (\gamma(0)) = \gamma_j (\mathbf{q}_0)
\end{align*}
$$

This shows that $\mathrm{d}f_{\mathbf{q}_0} = \omega_{\mathbf{q}_0}$ when $\mathbf{q}_0 \in \mathrm{int}(M)$.

For $\mathbf{q}_0 \in \partial M$, the chart $(U, (x^i))$ is a boundary chart centered at $\mathbf{q}_0$. The proof above shows that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^j}(\mathbf{q}_0) = \omega_j (\mathbf{q}_0)$ except in the case $j = n$. That case requires a special argument because $x^n$ takes on only nonnegative values in a boundary chart. In that case we simply set $\mathbf{p}_1 = \gamma(0)$ instead of $\mathbf{p}_1 = \gamma(-\varepsilon)$, and proceed as before. Then the same argument shows that $\mathrm{d}f_{\mathbf{q}_0} = \omega_{\mathbf{q}_0}$ in this case as well. This completes the proof that $\mathrm{d}f = \omega$ when $M$ is connected. Since the component functions of $\omega$ are smooth and equal to the partial derivatives of $f$ in coordinates, this also shows that $f$ is smooth.

Finally, if $M$ is not connected, let $\Set{M_i}$ be the components of $M$. The argument above shows that for each $i$ there is a function $f_i \in C^\infty (M_i)$ such that $\mathrm{d}f_i = \omega$ on $M_i$. Letting $f:M\to\R$ be the function that is equal to $f_i$ on $M$ for each $i$, we have $\mathrm{d}f = \omega$, thus completing the proof.

Let $f$ by any potential for $\omega$, and let $(U,(x^i))$ be any smooth chart on $M$. Because $f$ is smooth, its mixed partials are equal, giving

Writing $\omega = \omega \mathrm{d}x^i$ in coordinates, we see that $\omega = \mathrm{d}f$ is equivalent to $\omega_i = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}$. Substituting this into the mixed partials identity, we find that the component functions of $\omega$ satisfy the following identity for pair of indices $i$ and $j$:

\begin{align*}
  X(\omega(Y)) =& X(\omega_i Y^i) = Y^i X\omega_i + \omega_i XY^i \\
  =& Y^i X^j \frac{\partial \omega_i}{\partial x^j} + \omega_i XY^i
\end{align*}
$$

Also

$$
\begin{align*}
  Y(\omega(X)) =& Y(\omega_i X^i) = X^i Y\omega_i + \omega_i YX^i \\
  =& X^i Y^j \frac{\partial \omega_i}{\partial x^j} + \omega_i YX^i
\end{align*}
$$

such that

$$
\begin{align*}
  X(\omega(Y)) - Y(\omega(X)) =& Y^i X^j \frac{\partial \omega_i}{\partial x^j} + \omega_i XY^i \\
  &- X^j Y^i \frac{\partial \omega_j}{\partial x^i} + \omega_i YX^i \\
  =& \omega_i (XY^i - YX^i)
\end{align*}
$$

The coordinate formula for the Lie bracket shows that this last expression is equal to $\omega([X,Y])$.

Finally, if $\omega$ satisfies **(3)**, in any coordinate chart we can apply $X(\omega(Y)) - Y(\omega(X)) = \omega([X,Y])$ with $X = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$ and $Y = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}$, noting that $[X,Y] = 0$ in that case, to obtain $\frac{\partial\omega_j}{\partial x^i} = \frac{\partial\omega_i}{\partial x^j}$.

<MathBox title='' boxType='corollary'>
Suppose that $F:M\to N$ is a local diffeomorphism. Then the pullback $F^*: \mathfrak{X}^* (N) \to\mathfrak{X}^* (M)$ takes closed covector fields to closed covector fields, and exact ones to exact ones.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The result for exact covectors fields follows immediately from $F*\mathrm{d}u = \mathrm{d}(u\circ F)$. For closed vector fields, if $(U,\varphi)$ is any smooth chart for $N$, then $\varphi\circ F$ is a smooth chart for $M$ in a neighbourhood of each point of $F^{-1}(U)$. In these coordinates, the coordinate representation of $F$ is the identity, so if $\omega$ satisfies $\frac{\partial\omega_j}{\partial x^i} = \frac{\partial\omega_i}{\partial x^j}$ in $U$, then $F^* \omega$ satisfies $\frac{\partial\omega_j}{\partial x^i} = \frac{\partial\omega_i}{\partial x^j}$ in $F^{-1}(U)$.

If $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space, a subset $U\subseteq V$ is *star-shaped* if there is a point $\mathbf{c}\in U$ such that for every $\mathbf{x}\in U$, the line segment from $\mathbf{c}\to \mathcal{x}$ is entirely contained in $U$. In particular, every convex subset is star-shaped.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Pointaré lemma for covector fields' boxType='theorem'>
If $U$ is a star-shaped open subset of $\R^n$ or $H^n$, then every closed covector field on $U$ is exact.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $U$ is star-shaped with respect to $\mathbf{c}\in U$ and let $\omega = \omega_i \mathrm{d}x^i$ be a closed covector field on $U$. We will construct a potential function for $\omega$ by integrating along smooth curve segments from $\mathbf{c}$. However, we dot not know a priori that the line integrals are path-independent, so we must integrate along specific paths.

Because diffeomorphisms take closed forms to closed forms and exact one to exact one, we can apply a translation to $U$ to arrange that $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$. For any point $\mathbf{x}\in U$, let $\gamma_\mathbf{x}: [0,1]\to U$ denote the line segment from $\mathbf{0}$ to $\mathbf{x}$, parametrized as $\gamma_x (t) = t\mathbf{x}$. The hypothesis guarantees that the image of $\gamma_\mathbf{x}$ lies entirely in $U$ for each $\mathbf{x}\in U$. Define a function $f:U\to\R$ by

$$
  f(\mathbf{x}) = \int_{\gamma_\mathbf{x}} \omega
$$

We need to show that $f$ is a potential for $\omega$, or equivalently that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^j} = omega^j$ for $j=1,dots,n$. To begin, we compute

$$
\begin{align*}
  f(\mathbf{x}) =& \int_0^1 \omega_{\gamma_\mathbf{x} (t)}(\gamma'_\mathbf{x}(t))\;\mathrm{d}t \\
  =& \int_0^1 \omega_i (t\mathbf{x}) x^i \;\mathrm{d}t
\end{align*}
$$

To compute the partial derivative of $f$, we note that the integrand is smooth in all variables, so it is permissible to differentiate under the integral sign to obtain

$$
  frac{\partial f}{\partial x^j}(\mathbf{x}) = \int_0^1 \left( t\frac{\partial\omega_i}{\partial x^j}(t\mathbf{x})x^i + \omega_j (t\mathbf{x}) \right)\mathrm{d}t
$$

Because $\omega$ is close this reduces to

$$
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^j}(\mathbf{x}) =& \int_0^1 \left( t\frac{\partial\omega_i}{\partial x^i} (t\mathbf{x})x^i + \omega_j (t\mathbf{x}) \right)\mathrm{d}t \\
  =& \int_0^1 \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} (t\omega_j (t\mathbf{x}))\;\mathrm{d}t = [t\omega_j(t\mathbf{x})]_{t=0}^{t=1} \\
  =& \omega_j (\mathbf{x})
\end{align*}
$$

<MathBox title='Local exactness of closed covector fields' boxType='corollary'>
Let $\omega$ be a closed covector field on a smooth manifold $M$ with or without boundary. Then every point of $M$ has a neighbourhood on which $\omega$ is exact.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\mathbf{p}\in M$ be arbitrary. The hypothesis implies that $\omega$ satisfies $\frac{\partial\omega_j}{\partial x^i} = \frac{\partial\omega_i}{\partial x^j}$ in some smooth coordinate ball or half-ball $(U,\varphi)$ containing $\mathbf{p}$. Because balls and half-balls are convex, we can apply the Pointaré lemma to the coordinate representation of $\omega$ and conclude that there is a function $f\in C^\infty (U)$ such that $\omega|_U = \mathrm{d}f$.

# Tensors

## Multilinear algebra
<MathBox title='Multilinear map' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $V_1,\dots, V_k$ and $W$ are vector spaces. A map $F:V_1 \times\cdots\times V_k \to W$ is multilinear if it is linear as a function of variable separately when the others are held fixed, i.e. for each $i=1,\dots,k$ and $\alpha, \alpha'\in\R$

$$
\begin{align*}
  F(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\alpha\mathbf{v}_i + \alpha' \mathbf{v}'_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) =& \alpha F(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) \\
  &+ \alpha' F(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}'_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k)
\end{align*}
$$

The set of all multilinear maps from $V_1\times\cdots\times V_k$ to $W$ is denoted $\mathrm{L}(V_1,\dots,V_k;W)$. This is a vector space under the usual operations of pointwise addition and scalar multiplication

$$
\begin{align*}
  (F + F')(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) =& F(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) + F'(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) \\
  (\alpha F)(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) =& \alpha (F(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k))

<MathBox title='Tensor product' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $V_1,\dots, V_k, W_1,\dots W_l$ are vector spaces and suppose that $F \in\mathrm{L}(V_1,\dots,V_k;\R)$ and $G\in\mathrm{L}(W_1,\dots,W_l;\R)$. Define a function

$$
  F \otimes G: V_1\times\cdots\times V_k \times W_1 \times\cdots\times W_l \to \R
$$

by

$$
  F\otimes G (\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k,\mathbf{w}_1,\dots,\mathbf{w}_k) = F(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k)G(\mathbf{w}_1,\dots,\mathbf{w}_l)
$$

If follows from the multilinearity of $F$ and $G$ that $F\otimes G(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k,\mathbf{w}_1,\dots,\mathbf{w}_l)$ depends linearly on each argument $\mathbf{v}_i$ or $\mathbf{w}_j$ separately, so $F\otimes G \in L(V_1,\dots,V_k,W_1,\dots,W_l;\R)$ called. This is called the *tensor product* of $F$ and $G$.

If $\omega^j \in V_j^*$ for $j=1,\dots,k$, then $\omega^1 \otimes\cdots\otimes\omega^k \in\mathrm{L}(V_1,\dots,V_k;\R)$ is the multilinear function given by

$$
  \omega^1 \otimes\cdots\omega^k (\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = \omega^1 (\mathbf{v}_1)\cdots\omega^k (\mathbf{v}_k)

<MathBox title='A basis for the space of multilinear functions' boxType='proposition'>
Let $V_1,\dots,V_k$ be real vector spaces of dimensions $n_1,\dots,n_k$, respectively. For each $j\in\Set{1,\dots,k}$, let $(\mathbf{e}_i^{(j)},\dots, \mathbf{e}_{n_j}^{(j)})$ be a basis for $V_j$, and let $(\varepsilon_{(j)}^1,\dots,\varepsilon_{(j)}^{n_j})$ be the corresponding dual basis for $V_j^*$. Then the set

$$
  B = \Set{\varepsilon_{(1)}^{i_1} \otimes\cdots\otimes\varepsilon_{(k)}^{i_k} | 1\leq i_1 \leq n_1, \dots, 1 \leq i_k \leq n_k}
$$

is a basis for $\mathbf{L}(V_1,\dots,V_k;\R)$, which therefore has dimension equal to $\prod_{j=1}^k n_j$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

We need to show that $B$ is linearly independent and spans $\mathrm{L}(V_1,\dots,V_k;\R)$. Suppose that $F\in\mathrm{L}(V_1,\dots,V_k;\R)$ is arbitrary. For each ordered $k$-tuple $(i_1,\dots,i_k)$ of integers with $1 \leq i_j \leq n_j$, define a number $F_{i_k\dots i_k}$ by

$$
  F_{i_k\dots i_k} = F\left( \mathbf{e}_{i_1}^{(1)},\dots,\mathbf{e}_{i_k}^{(k)} \right)
$$

we will show that

$$
  F = F_{i_1\dots i_k} \varepsilon_{(1)}^{i_1} \otimes\cdots\otimes\varepsilon_{(k)}^{i_k}
$$

from which it follows that $B$ spans $\mathrm{L}(V_1,\dots,V_k;\R)$. For any $k$-tuple of vectors $(\mathbf{v}_j)_{j=1}^k \in \prod_{j=1}^k V_j$, write $\mathbf{v}_j = v_j^{i_j} \mathbf{e}_{i_j}^{(j)}$ and compute

$$
\begin{align*}
  F_{i_1\dots i_k} \varepsilon_{(1)}^{i_1} \otimes\cdots\otimes \varepsilon_{(k)}^{i_k} (\mathbf{v}_1,\dots, \mathbf{v}_k) =& F_{i_1\dots i_k} \varepsilon_{(1)}^{i_1} (\mathbf{v}_1)\cdots \varepsilon_{(k)}^{i_k}(\mathbf{v}_k) \\
  =& F_{i_1\dots i_k} v_{1}^{(i_1)} \cdots v_k^{i_k}
\end{align*}
$$

while $F(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k)$ is equal to the same by multilinearity. This proves the claim.

To show that $B$ is linearly indpendent, suppose that some linear combination equals zero:

$$
  F_{i_1\dots i_k} \varepsilon_{(1)}^{i_1} \otimes\cdots\otimes\varepsilon_{(k)}^{i_k} = 0
$$

Apply this to any ordered $k$-tuple of basis vectors, $(\mathbf{e}_{j_i}^{(i)})_{i=1}^{k}$. By the same computation as above, this implies that each coefficient $F_{j_1\dots j_k}$ is zero. Thus, the only linear combination of elements of $B$ that sums to zero is the trivial one.

### Abstract tensor products of vector spaces

<MathBox title='Free vector space' boxType='definition'>
For any set $S$, a *formal linear combination* of elements of $S$ is a function $f: S\to\R$ such that $f(s) = 0$ for all but finitely many $s\in S$. The *free vector space* on $S$, denoted $\mathcal{F}(S)$, is the set of all formal linear combination of elements of $S$. Under pointwise addition and scalar multiplication, $\mathcal{F}(S)$ becomes a vector space over $\R$.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

For each $x\in S$, there is a function $\delta_x \in \mathcal{F}(S)$ defined by

$$
  \delta_x(s) = \begin{cases}
    1,\quad& s = x \\
    0,\quad& s \neq x
  \end{cases}
$$

Typically we identify this function with $x$, and therefore think of $S$ as a subset of $\mathcal{F}(S)$. Every element $f\in \mathcal{F}(S)$ can then be uniquely written in the form $f = \sum_{i=1}^m a_i x_i$, where $x_1,\dots, x_m$ are the elements of $S$ for which $f(x_i) \neq = 0$, and $a_i = f(x_i)$. Thus, $S$ is a basis for $\mathcal{F}(S)$, which is therefore finite-dimensional if and only if $S$ is a finite set.

<MathBox title='Characteristic property of the free vector space' boxType='definition'>

<MathBox title='Tensor product space' boxType='definition'>
Let $V_1,\dots,V_k$ be real vector spaces and let $\mathcal{F}(V_1\times\cdots\times V_k)$ be the set of all finite formal linear combinations of $k$-tuples $(\mathbf{v}_i \in V_i)_{i=1}^k$. Let $\mathcal{R}$ be the subspace of $\mathcal{F}(V_1 \times\cdots\times V_k)$ spanned by all elements of the following forms

$$
\begin{gather}
  (\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\alpha\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) - \alpha(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k),\; \alpha\in\R \\

$$

The *tensor product space* of $V_1,\dots, V_k$ is defined as the quotient vectors space

$$
  \bigotimes_{i=1}^k V_i = \mathcal{F}\left(\prod_{i=1}^k V_i \right)/\mathcal{R}
$$

Let $\Pi: \mathcal{F}\left(\prod_{i=1}^k V_i \right) \to \bigotimes_{i=1}^k V_i$ be the natural projection. The equivalence class of an element $(\mathbf{v}_i)_{i=1}^k \in \bigotimes_{i=1}^k V_i$ is denoted by

$$
  \mathbf{v}_1 \otimes\cdots\mathbf{v}_k = \Pi(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k)
$$

and is called the *(abstract) tensor product* of $\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k$. It follows from the definition that the tensor product satisfies

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{v}_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes \alpha\mathbf{v}_i \otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{v}_k =& \alpha(\mathbf{v}_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{v}_i \otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{v}_k) \\
  \mathbf{v}_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes (\mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{v}'_i) \otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{v}_k =& (\mathbf{v}_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbf{v}_i \otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{v}_k) \\
  &+ (\mathbf{v}_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{v}'_i \otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{v}_k) 
\end{align*}
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Characteristic property of the tensor product space' boxType='proposition'>
Let $V_1,\dots, V_k$ be finite-dimensional real vector spaces. If $A: V_1 \times\cdots V_k \to X$ is any multilinear map into a vector space $X$, then there is a unique linear map $\tilde{A}: V_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes V_k$ such that the following diagram commutes

$$
\begin{CD}
  \prod_{i=1}^k V_i @>{A}>> X \\
  @V{\pi}VV @AA{\tilde{A}}A \\
  \bigotimes_{i=1}^k V_i @= \bigotimes_{i=1}^k V_i
\end{CD}
$$

where $\pi$ is the map $\pi(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = \mathbf{v}_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{v}_k$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Note that any map $A:\prod_{i=1}^k V_i \to X$ extends uniquely to a linear map $\overline{A}:\mathcal{F}\left(\prod_{i=1}^k V_i \right)\to X$ by the characteristic property of the free vector space. This map is characterized by the fact that $\overline{A}(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = A(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k)$ whenever $(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k)\in \prod_{i=1}^k V_i \subseteq \mathcal{F}\left(\prod_{i=1}^k V_i \right)$. The fact that $A$ is multilinear means precisely that the subspace $\mathcal{R}$ is contained in the kernel of $\overline{A}$, because

$$
\begin{align*}
  \overline{A}(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\alpha\mathbf{v}_i\,dots,\mathbf{v}_k) =& A(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\alpha\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) \\
  =& \alpha A(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) \\
  =& a\overline{A}(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) \\
  =& \overline{A}(\alpha(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k))
\end{align*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{align*}
  \overline{A}(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{v}'_i \,dots,\mathbf{v}_k) =& A(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{v}'_i \,dots,\mathbf{v}_k) \\
  =& A(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) \\
  &+ A(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}'_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k)
  =& \overline{A}(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) \\
  &+ \overline{A}(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}'_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) \\
  =& \overline{A}((\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) + (\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}'_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k))
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, $\overline{A}$ descends to a linear map $\tilde{A}: \bigotimes_{i=1}^k V_i  = \mathcal{F}\left(\prod_{i=1}^k V_i \right)/\mathcal{R}$ satisfying $\tilde{A}\circ\Pi = \overline{A}$. Since $\pi$ is equal to the inclusion $\prod_{i=1}^k V_i \hookrightarrow \mathcal{F}\left(\prod_{i=1}^k V_i \right)$ followed by $\Pi$, this implies $\tilde{A}\circ\pi = A$, which is in accordance with the stated commutative diagram. Uniqueness follows from the fact that every element of $V_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes V_k$ can be written as a linear combination of elements of the form $\mathbf{v}_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{v}_k$, and $\tilde{A}$ is uniquely determined on such elements by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{A}(\mathbf{v}_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{v}_k) =& \overline{A}(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) \\
  =& A(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k)

is a basis for $\bigotimes_{i=1}^k V_i$, which therefore has dimension equal to $\prod_{j=1}^k n_j$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Elements of the form $\mathbf{v}_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{v}_k$ span the tensor product space by definition. Expanding each $\mathbf{v}_i$ in such an expression in terms of its basis representation shows that $B$ spans $\bigotimes_{i=1}^k V_i$.

To prove that $B$ is linearly independent, assume that some linear combination of elements of $B$ is equal to zero:

$$
  a^{i_1\dots i_k} \mathbf{e}_{i_1}^{(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{e}_{i_k}^{(k)} = \mathbf{0}
$$

For each ordered $k$-tuple of indices $(m_1,\dots,m_k)$, define a multilinear function $\tau^{m_1\dots m_k}: \prod_{i=1}^k V_i \to\R$ by

$$
  \tau^{m_1\dots m_k} (\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = \varepsilon_{(1)}^{m_1}(\mathbf{v}_1)\cdots\varepsilon_{(k)}^{m_k}(\mathbf{v}_k)
$$

where $\left( \varepsilon_{(j)}^i \right)$ is the basis for $V_j^*$ dual to $(\mathbf{e}_i^{(j)})$. Because $\tau^{m_1\dots m_k}$ is multilinear, it descends to a linear to a linear function $\tilde{\tau}^{m_1\dots m_k}: \bigotimes_{i=1}^k V_k \to\R$ by the characteristic property of the tensor product. It follows That

$$
\begin{align*}
  0 =& \tilde{\tau}^{m_1\dots m_k} ( a^{i_1\dots i_k} \mathbf{e}_{i_1}^{(1)} \otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{e}_{i_k}^{(k)}) \\
  =& a^{i_i \dots i_k} \tau^{m_1 \dots m_k} (\mathbf{e}_{i_1}^{(1)} \otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{e}_{i_k}^{(k)}) \\
  =& a^{m_1\dots m_k} 
\end{align*}
$$

which shows that $B$ is linearly independent.

We construct the isomorphism $V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes V_3 \cong (V_1 \otimes V_2) \cong V_3$; the other one is constructed similarly. The map $\alpha: V_1\times V_2 \times V_3 \to (V_1 \otimes V_2) \otimes V_3$ defined bY

$$
  \alpha(\mathbf{v}_1,\mathbf{v}_2,\mathbf{v}_3) = (\mathbf{v}_1 \otimes\mathbf{v}_2)\otimes\mathbf{v}_3
$$

is obviously multilinear, and thus by the characteristic property of the tensor product it descends uniquely to a linear map $\tilde{\alpha}: V_1\otimes V_2\otimes V_3 \to (V_1 \otimes V_2)\otimes V_3$ satisfying $\tilde{\alpha}(\mathbf{v}_1 \otimes \mathbf{v}_2 \otimes \mathbf{v}_3) = (\mathbf{v}_1 \otimes \mathbf{v}_2) \otimes \mathbf{v}_3$ for all $\mathbf{v}_i \in V_i$, where $i = 1,2,3$. Because $(V_1 \otimes V_2) \otimes V_3$ is spanned by elements of the form $(\mathbf{v}_1 \otimes \mathbf{v}_2)\otimes \mathbf{v}_3$, it follows that $\tilde{\alpha}$ is surjective, and therefore it is an isomorphism for dimensional reasons. It is clearly the unique such isomorphism, because any other would have to agree with $\tilde{\alpha}$ on the set of all elements of the form $\mathbf{v}_1 \otimes\mathbf{v}_2 \otimes\mathbf{v}_3$, which spans $V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes V_3$.

If $V_1,\dots,V_k$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces, there is a canonical isomorphism

under which the abstract tensor product corresponds to the product of covectors.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

First define a map $\Phi: \prod_{i=1}^k V_i^* \to\mathrm{L}(V_i,\dots,V_k;\R)$ bY

$$
  \Phi(\omega^1,\dots,\omega^k)(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = \prod_{i=1}^k \omega^i (\mathbf{v}_i)
$$

The expression on the right depends linearly on each $\mathbf{v}_i$ so $\Phi(\omega^1,\dots,\omega^k)$ is indeed an element of the space $\mathrm{L}(V_1,\dots,V_k;\R)$. It is easy to check that $\Phi$ is multilinear as a function of $\omega^1,\dots,\omega^k$, so by the characteristic property it descends uniquely to a linear map $\tilde{\Phi}$ from $\bigotimes_{i=1}^k V_i^*$ to $\mathrm{L}(V_1,\dots,V_k;\R)$, which satisfies

$$
  \tilde{\Phi}\left(\bigotimes_{i=1}^k \omega^i \right)(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = \prod_{i=1}^k \omega_i (\mathbf{v}_i)
$$

It follows immediately from the definition that $\tilde{Phi}$ takes abstract tensor products to tensor products of covectors. It also thakes the basis of $\bigotimes_{i=1}^k V_1^*$ to the basis for $\mathrm{L}(V_1,\dots,V_k;\R)$, so it is an isomorphism.

If $V_1,\dots,V_k$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces, we can also identify each $V_j$ with its second dual space $V_j^**$, and thereby obtain another canonical identification

  \bigotimes_{i=1}^k V_i \cong \mathrm{L}(V_1^*,\dots,V_k^*;\R)
$$

### Covariant and contravariant tensors on a vector space

<MathBox title='Covariant tensor' boxType='definition'>
Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional real vector space. If $k\in\N^+$, a *covariant* $k$-tensor on $V$ is an element of the $k$-fold tensor product $\bigotimes_{i=1}^k V^*$, which can be represented as a multilinear functional $T: \prod_{i=1}^k V \to\R$, called a $k$-form. If $(\mathbf{e}_i)_{i=1}^n$ is a basis for $V$, then the components of $T$ are given by

$$
  T_{j_1\dots j_k} = T(\mathbf{e}_{j_1},\dots,\mathbf{e}_{j_k}),\; 1\leq j_1,\dots,j_k \leq n
$$

The number $k$ is called the *covariant rank* of $T$. The vector space of all covariant $k$-tensors on $V$ is denoted

$$
  T_k (V^*) = \bigotimes_{i=1}^k V^*
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Contravariant tensor' boxType='definition'>
Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional real vector space. If $k\in\N^+$, a *contravariant* $k$-tensor on $V$ is an element of the $k$-fold tensor product $\bigotimes_{i=1}^k V$, which can be represented as a multilinear operator $T: \prod_{i=1}^k V^* \to\R
$. If $(\varepsilon^i)_{i=1}^n$ is a basis for $V^*$, the components of $T$ are given by

$$
  T^{j_1\dots j_k} = T(\varepsilon^{j_1},\dots, \varepsilon^{j_k}),\; 1\leq j_1,\dots,j_k \leq n
$$

The number $k$ is called the *contravariant rank* of $T$. The vector space of all contravariant $k$-tensors on $V$ is denoted

$$
  T^k (V) = \bigotimes_{i=1}^k V
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Mixed tensor' boxType='definition'>
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space. A tensor with covariant rank $p$ and contravariant rank $q$, denoted $(p,q)$-rank tensor, is an element of the $(p+q)$-fold tensor product $\left(\bigotimes_{i=1}^p V\right)\otimes\left(\bigotimes_{i=1}^q V^*\right)$, which can be represented as a multilinear operator $T: \left(\prod_{i=1}^p V^*\right)\times\left(\prod_{i=1}^q V\right)\to\R$. If $(\mathbf{e}_i)_{i=1}^n$ is a basis for $V$ and $(\varepsilon^i)_{i=1}^n$ is the corresponding basis for $V^*$, the components of $T$ are given by

$$
  T_{k_1\dots k_q}^{j_1\dots j_p} = T(\varepsilon^{j_1},\dots,\varepsilon^{j_p}, \mathbf{e}_{k_1},\dots,\mathbf{e}_{k_p})
$$

The vector space all $(p,q)$-tensors on $V$ is denoted

is denoted

$$
  T_q^p (V) = \left(\bigotimes_{i=1}^p V^*\right) \otimes \left(\bigotimes_{i=1}^q V\right)
$$
</MathBox>

Note the following particular cases of tensors
- $0$-rank tensors are scalars, i.e. $T_0^0 (V) = T_0 (V^*) = T^0 (V) = \R$
- $1$-rank covariant tensors are covectors, i.e. $T_1^0 (V) = T_1 (V^*) = V^*$
- $1$-rank contravariant tensors are vectors, i.e. $T_0^1 (V) = T^1 (V) = V$

<MathBox title='Bases for tensor spaces' boxType='proposition'>
Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional real vector space. Suppose that $(\mathbf{e}_j)_{j=1}^n$ is any basis for $V$, and $(\varepsilon^j)_{j=1}^n$ is the corresponding dual basis for $V^*$. Then the following sets constitute bases for the tensor spaces over $V$

- $k$-rank covariant tensor space $T_k (V^*)$
$$
  \Set{\bigotimes_{j=1}^k \varepsilon^{i_j} | 1\leq i_1,\dots i_k \leq n }
$$
- $k$-rank contravariant tensor space $T^k (V)$
$$
  \Set{\bigotimes_{j=1}^k \mathbf{e}_{i_j} | 1\leq i_1,\dots i_k \leq n }
$$
- $(p,q)$-rank tensor space $T_q^p (V)$
$$
  \Set{\left( \bigotimes_{k=1}^p \mathbf{e}_{i_j} \right) \otimes \left(\bigotimes_{k=1}^q \varepsilon_{j_k} \right) | 1 \leq i_1,\dots,i_p, j_1,\dots,j_q \leq n}
$$

Thus, $\dim(T^k (V^*)) = \dim(T_k(V)) = n^k$ and $\dim(T_q^p (V)) = n^{p+q}$.
</MathBox>

## Symmetric tensors

<MathBox title='Symmetric tensor' boxType='definition'>
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space. A covariant $k$-tensor $T$ on $V$ is *symmetric* if its values is unchanged by interchanging any pair of arguments, i.e.

$$
  T(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_j,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = T(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_j,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k)
$$

whenever $1 \leq i < j \leq k$.

The set of symmetric covariant $k$-tensors, denoted $\sigma_k (V^*)$, is a linear subpace of the space of $T_k (V^*)$ of all covariant $k$-tensors on $V$, i.e. $\Sigma_k (V^*) \subseteq T_k (V^*)$. There is a natural projection from $T_k (V^*)$ to $\Sigma_k (V^*)$ defined as follows. Let $S_k$ denote the *symmetric group* on $k$ elements. That is, the group of permutations of the set $\Set{1,\dots,k}$. Given a $k$-tensor $\alpha$ and a permutation $\sigma\in S_k$, we define a new $k$-tensor $^\sigma \alpha$ bY

$$
  ^\sigma \alpha(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = \alpha(\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(1)},\dots,\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(k)})
$$

Note that $^\tau(^\tau \alpha) = ^{\tau\sigma}\alpha$, where $\tau\sigma$ represents the composition of $\tau$ and $\alpha$, i.e. $\tau\sigma(i) = \tau(\sigma(i))$. We define a projection $\mathrm{sym}: T_k (V^*) \to\sigma_k (V^*)$ called *symmetrization* bY

$$
  \mathrm{sym}(\alpha) = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_k} ^\sigma \alpha
$$

More explicitly, this means that

$$
  (\mathrm{sym}(\alpha))(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_k} \alpha(\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(1)},\dots,\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(k)})
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of symmetrization' boxType='proposition'>
Let $\alpha$ be a covariant tensor on a finite-dimensional vector space.
1. $\mathrm{sym}(\alpha)$ is symmetric
2. $\mathrm{sym}(\alpha) = \alpha$ if and only if $\alpha$ is symmetric

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Suppose that $\alpha\in T_k (V^*)$. If $\tau\in S_k$ is any permutation, then

$$
\begin{align*}
  (\mathrm{sym}(\alpha))(\mathbf{v}_{\tau(1)},\dots,\mathbf{v}_{\tau(k)}) =& \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_k} ^\sigma \alpha (\mathbf{v}_{\tau}(1),\dots,\mathbf{v}_{\tau(k)}) \\
  =& \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_k} ^{\tau\sigma} \alpha(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) \\
  =& \frac{1}{k!}\sun_{\eta\in S_k} ^\eta \alpha(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) \\
  =& (\mathrm{sym}(\alpha))(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k)
\end{align*}
$$

where we have substituted $\eta = \tau\sigma$ and used the fact that $\eta$ runs over all of $S_k$ as $\sigma$ does. This shows that $\mathrm{sym}(\alpha)$ is symmetric.

**(2):** If $\alpha$ is symmetric, then it follows that $^\sigma \alpha = \alpha$ for every $\alpha\in S_k$. It follows immediately that $\mathrm{sym}(\alpha) = \alpha$. On the other hand, if $\mathrm{sym}(\alpha) = \alpha$, then $\alpha$ is symmetric because **(1)** shows that $\mathrm{sym}(\alpha)$ is.

<MathBox title='Symmetric product' boxType='definition'>
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space. If $\alpha\in\Sigma_k (V^*)$ and $\beta\in\Sigma_l (V^*)$, their *symmetric product* is the $(k+l)$-tensor $\alpha\beta$ defined bY

$$
  \alpha\beta := \mathrm{sym}(\alpha\otimes\beta)
$$

More explicitly, the action of $\alpha\beta$ on vectors $\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_{k+l}$ isolated

$$
  \alpha\beta(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_{k+l}) = \frac{1}{(k+l)!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_{k+l}} \alpha(\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(1)},\dots,\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(k)})\beta(\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(k+1)},\dots,\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(k+l)})
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of the symmetric product' boxType='proposition'>
1. The symmetric product is symmetric and bilinear: for all symmetric tensors $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ and all $a,b\in\R$
    - $\alpha\beta =& \beta\alpha$
    - $(a\alpha + b\beta)\gamma = a\alpha\gamma + b\beta\gamma = \gamma(a\alpha + b\beta)$
2. If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are covectors, then $\alpha\beta = \frac{1}{2}(\alpha\otimes\beta + \beta\otimes\alpha)$
</MathBox>

## Alternating tensors

<MathBox title='Alternating tensor' boxType='definition'>
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space. A covariant $k$-tensor $T$ is *alternating* (or *antisymmetric* or *skew-symmetric*) if it changes sign whenever two of its agruments are interchanged. This means that for all vectors $\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k \in V$ and every distring indices $i, j$ it satisfies

$$
  T(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_j),\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = -T(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_j,\dots,\mathbf{v}_i,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k)
$$

Alternating tensors are also variously called *exterior forms*, *multicovectors* or *k-covectors*. The subspace of all alternating covariant $k$-tensors on $V$ is denoted by $\Lambda_k (V^*) \subseteq T_k (V^*)$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Sign' boxType='definition'>
For any permutation $\sigma\in S_k$, the *sign* of $\sigma$, denoted $\mathrm{sgn}(\sigma)$, is defined As

$$
  \mathrm{sgn}(\sigma) = \begin{cases}
    +1,\quad& \sigma\text{ is even} \\
    -1,\quad& \sigma\text{ is odd}
  \end{cases}
$$
</MathBox>

Every $0$-tensor, which is a scalar, is both symmetric and alternating, because there no arguments to interchange. Similarly, every $1$-form is both symmetric and alternating. Every $2$-form is a skew-symmetric bilinear form. Note that every *2*-form $\beta$ can be expressed as a sum of an alternating tensor and symmetric one, because

$$
\begin{align*}
  \beta(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}) =& \frac{1}{2}(\beta(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}) - \beta(\mathbf{w}, \mathbf{v})) + \frac{1}{2}(\beta(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}) + \beta(\mathbf{w},\mathbf{v})) \\
  =& \alpha (\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}) + \sigma(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}) 
\end{align*}
$$

where $\alpha(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2}(\beta(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}) - \beta(\mathbf{w},\mathbf{v}))$ is an alternating tensor and $\sigma(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{\beta}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}) - \beta(\mathbf{w},\mathbf{v}))$ is symmetric.

## Tensors and tensor fields on manifolds

<MathBox title='Tensor bundle' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. The bundle of covariant $k$-tensors on $M$ is defined as

$$
  T_k T^* M = \bigsqcup_{\mathbf{p}\in M} T_k (T_\mathbf{p}^* M)
$$

Analogously, the bundle of contravariant $k$-tensors is defined as

$$
  T^k TM = \bigsqcup_{\mathbf{p}\in M} T^k (T_\mathbf{p} M)
$$

The bundle of mixed $(p,q)$-rank tensors is defined as

$$
  T_q^p TM = \bigsqcup_{\mathbf{p}\in M} T_q^p (T_\mathbf{p} M)
$$

A section of a tensor bundle is called a *tensor field* on $M$. A *smooth tensor field* is a section that is smooth in the usual sense of smooth section of vector bundles.
</MathBox>

Note the following natural identitities of tensor bundles
- $T_0^0 TM = T_0 M^* M = T^0 TM = M\times\R$
- $T_1^0 TM = T_1 T^* M = T* M$, i.e. covariant $1$-tensors are covector fields
- $T_0^1 TM = T^1 TM = TM$, i.e. contravariant $1$-tensors are vector fields
- $T_k^0 TM = T_k T^* M$
- $T_0^k TM = T^k TM$

The spaces of smooth sections of tensor bundles, denoted
- $\Gamma(T_k T^* M) = \mathcal{T}_k (M)$
- $\Gamma(T^k TM)$
- $\Gamma(T_q^p TM)$

are infinite-dimensional vector spaces over $\R$, and modules over $C^\infty (M)$. In any smooth local coordinates $(x^i)$, sections of these bundles can be written as

$$
  A = \begin{cases}
    A_{i_1 \dots i_q} \bigotimes_{j=1}^q \mathrm{d}x^{i_j},\quad& A\in\gamma(T_q T^* M) \\
    A^{i_1 \dots i_p} \bigotimes_{j=1}^p \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i_j}},\quad& A\in\gamma(T^p TM) \\
    A_{j_l \dots j_q}^{i_k \dots i_p} \left( \bigotimes_{k=1}^p \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i_j}} \right) \otimes \left( \bigotimes_{l=1}^q \mathrm{d}x^{j_l} \right),\quad& A\in \Gamma(T_q^p TM)
  \end{cases}
$$

The functions $A_{i_1 \dots i_q}$, $A^{i_1 \dots i_p}$ and $A_{j_l \dots j_q}^{i_k \dots i_p}$ are called the *component functions* of $A$ in the choosen coordinates.

<MathBox title='Smoothness criteria for tensor fields' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and let $A:M\to T_k T^* M$ be a rough section. Then the following are equivalent.
1. $A$ is smooth
2. In every smooth coordinate chart, the component functions of $A$ are smooth
3. Each point of $M$ is contained in some coordinate chart in which $A$ has smooth component functions.
4. If $X_1,\dots,X_k \in\mathfrak{X}(M)$, then the function $A(X_1,\dots,X_k):M\to\R$, defined by
$$
  A(X_1,\dots,X_k)(\mathbf{p}) = A_\mathbf{p}(X_1|_\mathbf{p},\dots,\mathbf{X}_k|_\mathbf{p})
$$
is smooth.
5. Whenever $X_1,\dots,X_k$ are smooth vector fields defined on some open subset $U\subseteq M$, the function $A(X_1,\dots,X_k)$ is smooth on $U$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundaru, $A\in\mathcal{T}_k (M)$, $B\in\mathcal{T}_l (M)$ and that $f\in C^\infty(M)$. Then $fA$ nad $A\otimes B$ are also smooth tensor fields, whose components in any smooth local coordinate chart are

$$
\begin{align*}
  (fA)_{i_1 \dots i_k} =& fA_{i_1 \dots i_k} \\
  (A\otimes B)_{i_1 \dots i_{k+l}} = A_{i_1 \dots i_k} B_{i_{k+1} \dots i_{k+l}}
\end{align*}
$$
</MathBox>

If $A$ is a smooth covariant $k$-tensor field on a smooth manifold $M$, and $X_1,\dots,X_k$ are smooth vector fields, then by the by the smoothness criteria, then $A(X_1,\dots,X_k)$ is a smooth real-valued function on $M$. Thus $A$ induces a map $ \prod_{i=1}^k \mathfrak{X}(M) \to C^\infty (M)$. It is easy to see that this map is multilinear over $\R$. In fact, it is actually multilinear over $C^\infty (M)$, which means that for $f, g \in C^\infty(M)$ an $X_i, Y_i \in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  &A(X_1,\dots, fX_i + g Y_i, \dots, X_k) \\
  &= fA(X_1,\dots,X_i,\dots,X_k) + gA(X_1,\dots,Y_i,\dots,Y_k)
\end{align*}
$$

<MathBox title='Tensor characterization lemma' boxType='lemma'>
A map

$$
  \mathcal{A}: \prod_{i=1}^k \mathfrak{X}(M) \to C^\infty (M)
$$

is induced by a smooth covariant $k$-tensor field if and only if $\mathcal{A}$ is multilinear over $C^\infty(M)$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Note that if $A$ is a smooth covariant $k$-tensor field, then the map $(X_1,\dots,X_k)\mapsto A(X_1,\dots,X_k)$ is multilinear over $C^\infty (M)$. To prove the converse, we proceeds as in the proof of the bundle homomorphism characterization lemma.

Suppose that $\mathcal{A}$ is multilinear over $C^\infty (M)$. We sho first that $\mathcal{A}$ acts locally. If $X_i$ is a smooth vector field that vanishes on a neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{p}$, we can choose a bump function $\psi$ supported in $U$ such that $\psi(\mathbf{p}) = 1$, then because $\psi X_i \equiv 0$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  0 =& \mathcal{A}(X_1,\dots, \psi X_i, \dots, X_k)(\mathbf{p}) \\
  =& \psi(\mathbf{p})\mathcal{A}(X_1,\dots,X_i,\dots,X_k)(\mathbf{p})
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that the value of $\mathcal{A}(X_1,\dots,X_k)$ at $\mathbf{p}$ depends only on the values of $X_1,\dots,X_k$ in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$.

Next we show that $\mathcal{A}$ actually acts pointwise. If $X_i|_\mathbf{p} = 0$, then in any coordinate chart centered at $\mathbf{p}$ we can write $X_i = X_i^j \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}$, where the component functions $X_i^j$ all vanish at $\mathbf{p}$. By the extension lemma for vector fields, we can find global smooth vector fields $E_j$ on $M$ such that $E_j = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}$ in some neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$. Similarly, the locally defined functions $X_i^j$ can be extended to global smooth functions $f_i^j$ on $M$ that agree with $X_i^j$ in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$. It follows from the multilinearity of $\mathcal{A}$ over $C^\infty (M)$, and the fact that $f_i^j E_j = X_i$ in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ that

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{A}(X_1,\dots,X_i,\dots,X_k)(\mathbf{p}) =& \mathcal{A}(X_1,\dots,f_i^j E_j,\dots, X_k)(\mathbf{p}) \\
  =& f_i^j (\mathbf{p})\mathcal{A}(X_1,\dots,E_j,\dots,X_k)(\mathbf{p}) = 0
\end{align*}
$$

It follows by linearity that $\mathcal{A}(X_1,\dots,X_k)$ depends only on the value of $X_i$ at $\mathbf{p}$.

We define a rough tensor field $A:M\to T_k T^* M$ by

$$
  A_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = \mathcal{A}(V_1,\dots,V_k)(\mathbf{p}),\; \mathbf{p}\in M, \mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k \in T_\mathbf{p}M
$$

where $V_1,\dots,V_k$ are any extension of $\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k$ to smooth global vector fields on $M$. The discussion abouve shows that this is independent of the choices of extension, and the resulting tensor field is smooth by the smoothness criteria.

A *symmetric tensor field* on a manifold (with or without boundary) is simply a covariant tensor field whose value at each point is a symmetric tensor. The symmetric product of two or more tensor fields is defined pointwise, just like the tensor product. Thus, if $A$ and $B$ are smooth covector fields, their symmetric product is the smooth $2$-tensor field $AB$, which is given by

$$
  AB = \frac{1}{2}(A\otimes B + B\otimes A)
$$

Alternating tensor fields are called *differential forms*.

### Pullbacks of tensor fields

<MathBox title='Tensor field pullback' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and suppose that $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map. For any point $\mathbf{p}\in M$, we define a tensor $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}^* (\alpha) \in T_k (T_\mathbf{p}^* M)$, called the *pointwise pullback* of $\alpha$ by $F$ at $\mathbf{p}$ by

$$
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}^* (\alpha)(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = \alpha(\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}_1), \dots,\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}_k)),\; \mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k \in T_\mathbf{p}M
$$

If $A$ is a covariant $k$-tensor field on $N$, we define a rough $k$-tensor field $F^* A$ on $M$, called the *pullback* of $A$ by $F$, by

$$
  (F^* A)_\mathbf{p} = \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}^* (A_{F(\mathbf{p})})
$$

This tensor field acts on vectors $\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k \in T_\mathbf{p} M$ by

$$
  (F^* A)_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = A_{F(\mathbf{p})}(\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}_1),\dots,\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}_k))
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of tensor pullbacks' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $F:M\to N$ and $G:N\to P$ are smooth maps, $A$ and $B$ are covariant tensor fields on $N$, and $f:N\to\R$ is a real-valued function on $f$.
1. $F^* (fB) = (f\circ F) F^* B$
2. $F*(A\otimes B) = F^* = F^* A \otimes F^* B$
3. $F^* (A+B) =F^* A + F^* B$
4. $F^* B$ is a (continuous) tensor field, and is smooth if $B$ is smooth
5. $(G\circ F)^* B = F^* (G^* B)$
6. (\mathrm{id}_N)^* B = B
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='corollary'>
Let $F:M\to N$ be smooth, and let $B$ be a covariant $k$-tensor field on $N$. If $\mathbf{p}\in M$ and $(y^i)$ are smooth coordinates for $N$ on a neighbourhood of $F(\mathbf{p})$, then $F^* B$ has the following expression in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$

$$
  F^* (B_{i_1 \dots i_k} \bigotimes_{j=1}^k \mathrm{d}y^{i_j}) = (B_{i_1 \dots i_k} \circ F) \left(\bigotimes_{j=1}^k \mathrm{d}(y^{i_j} \circ F) \right)
$$
</MathBox>

In general, there is neither a pushforwar nor a pullback operation for mixed tensor fields. However, in the special case of a diffeomorphism, tensor fields of any variance can be pushed forward and pulled back at will.

### Lie derivatives of tensor fields

<MathBox title='Lie derivative of a tensor field' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold, $V$ is a smooth vector field on $M$, and that $\theta$ is its flow. For any $\mathbf{p}\in M$, if $t$ is sufficiently close to zero, then $\theta_t$ is a diffeomorphism from a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ to a neighbourhood of $\theta_t (\mathbf{p})$, so $\mathrm{d}(\theta_t)_\mathbf{p}^*$ pulls back tensors at $\theta_t (\mathbf{p})$ to ones at $\mathbf{p}$ by the formula

$$
  \mathrm{d}(\theta_t)_\mathbf{p}^* (A_{\theta_t (\mathbf{p})})(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_k) = A_{\theta_t (\mathbf{p})}(\mathrm{d}(\theta_t)_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}_1),\dots,\mathrm{d}(\theta_t)_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}_k))
$$

Note that $\mathrm{d}(\theta_t)_\mathbf{p}^* (A_\theta_t (\mathbf{p}))$ is just the value of the pullback tensor field $\theta_t^* A$ at $\mathbf{p}$.

Given a smooth covariant tensor field $A$ on $M$, the *Lie derivative* of $A$ with respect to $V$, denoted $\mathcal{L}_V A$, is defined by

$$
\begin{align*}
  (\mathcal{L}_V A)_\mathbf{p} =& \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t=0} (\theta_t^* A)_\mathbf{p} \\
  =& \lim_{t\to 0} \frac{\mathrm{d}(\theta_t)_\mathbf{p}^* (A_{\theta_t(\mathbf{p})}) - A_\mathbf{p}}{t}
\end{align*}
$$

provided that the derivative exists. Because the expression being differentiated lies in $T_k (T_\mathbf{p}^* M)$ for all $t$, then $(\mathcal{L}_V A)_\mathbf{p}$ makes sense as an element of $T_k (T_\mathbf{p}^* M$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='lemma'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold, $V$ is a smooth vector field on $M$, and that $\theta$ is its flow. The Lie derivative exists for every $\mathbf{p}\in M$ and defines $\mathcal{L}_V A$ as a smooth tensor field on $M$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of Lie derivatives of tensor fields' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $V\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$. Suppose that $f$ is a smooth real-valued function on $0$, and that $A$ and $B$ are smooth covariant tensor fields on $M$.
1. $\mathcal{L}_V f = Vf$
2. $\mathcal{L}_V (fA) = (\mathcal{L}_V f)A + f\mathcal{L}_V A$
3. $\mathcal{L}_V (A\otimes B) = (\mathcal{L}_V A)\otimes B + A \otimes \mathcal{L}_V B$
4. If $X_1,\dots,X_k\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ and $A$ is a smooth $k$-tensor field,
$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{L}_V (A(X_1,\dots,X_k)) =& (\mathcal{L}_V A)(X_1,\dots,X_k) \\
  &+ A(\mathcal{L}_V X_1,\dots,X_k) + \cdots + A(X_1,\dots, \mathcal{L}_V X_k)

**(1):** Let $\theta$ be the flow of $V$. For a real-valued function $f$ we can write

$$
  \theta_t^* f(\mathbf{p}) = f(\theta_t (\mathbf{p})) = f\circ\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}(t)
$$

Thus, the definition of $\mathcal{L}_V f$ reduces to the ordinary derivative with respect to $t$ of the composite function $f\circ\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$. Because $\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}$ is an integral curve of $V$, it follows that

$$
\begin{align*}
  (\mathcal{L}_V f)(\mathbf{p}) =& \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t=0} f\circ\theta^{(\mathbf{p})} \\
  =& \mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p} (\theta^{(\mathbf{p})}' (0)) = \mathrm{d}f_\mathbf{p}(V_\mathbf{p}) \\
  =& Vf(\mathbf{p})
\end{align*}
$$

This proves **(1)**.

The other assertions can be proved by the techniques used in the theorem for the equivalnce of the Lie derivative with the Lie bracket. In a neighbourhood of a regular point for $V$, if $(u^i)$ are coordinates in which $V = \frac{\partial}{\partial u^1}$, then it follows immediately from the definition that $\mathcal{L}_V$ acts on a tensor field simply by taking the partial derivative of its coefficients with respect to $u^1$, and **(2)**-**(4)** all follow from the ordinary product rule. The same relations hold on the support of $V$ by continuity, and on the complement of the support because the flow of $V$ is trivial here.

# Riemannian metrics

## Riemannian manifold
<MathBox title='Riemannian metric' boxType='definition'>
A Riemannian metric on a smooth manifold $M$ is a smooth symmetric covariant $2$-tensor field $g$ on $M$ that is positive definite at each point. For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the 2-form $g_\mathbf{p}$ is an inner product on $T_\mathbf{p} M$, usually denoted

$$
  \langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \rangle_g = g_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}),\; \mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\in T_\mathbf{p} M
$$

In any smooth local coordinates $(x^i)$, a Riemannian metric can be written

$$
  g = g_{ij}\;\mathrm{d}x^i \otimes \mathrm{d}x^j
$$

where $(g_{ij})$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix of smooth functions, i.e. $g_{ij} = g_{ji}$. The symmetry of $g$ allows us to write $g$ in terms of symmetric products

$$
\begin{align*}
  g =& g_{ij}\;\mathrm{d}x^i \otimes \mathrm{d}x^j \\
  =& \frac{1}{2}(g_{ij}\;\mathrm{d}x^i \otimes \mathrm{d}x^j + g_{ji}\;\mathrm{d}x^i \otimes \mathrm{d}x^j) \\
  =& \frac{1}{2}(g_{ij}\;\mathrm{d}x^i \otimes \mathrm{d}x^j + g_{ij}\;\mathrm{d}x^j \otimes \mathrm{d}x^i) \\
  =& g_{ij} \;\mathrm{d}x^i\;\mathrm{d}x^j
\end{align*}
$$
</MathBox>

Note that a Riemannian metric is not the same thing as a metric in the sense of metric spaces, although the two concepts are related. To avoid this ambiguity, we will use the term "distance function" for a metic in the metric space sense.

<MathBox title='Riemannian metric' boxType='definition'>
A *Riemannian manifold* is a pair $(M, g)$, where $M$ is smoth manifold and $g$ is a Riemannian metric. It is common to state that "M is a Riemannian manifold" if $M$ understood to be endowed with a Riemannian metric.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Euclidean metric' boxType='example'>
The simple example of a Riemannian metric is the *Euclidean metric* $\overline{g}$ on $\R^n$, given in standard coordinates bY

$$
  \overline{g} = \delta_{ij}\;\mathrm{d}x^i \;\mathrm{d}x^j
$$

where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Applied to vectors $\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}\in T_\mathbf{p}\R^n$, this yields

$$
  \overline{g}_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}) = \delta_{ij} \mathbf{v}^i \mathbf{w}^j = \sum_{i=1}^n v^i w^i = \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{w}
$$

which shows that $\overline{g}$ is the covariant $2$-tensor field whose value at each point is the Euclidean dot product.
</MathBox>

The following geometric construction can be defined on a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ with or without boundary
- The *length* or *norm* of tangent vector $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p}M$:
$$
  |\mathbf{v}|_g = \langle \sqrt{\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}\rangle_g} = \sqrt{g_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w})}
$$
- The *angle* between two nonzero tangent vectors $\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\in T_\mathbf{p} M$ is the the unique $\theta\in[0,\pi]$ satisfying
$$
  \cos(\theta) = \frac{\langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \rangle_g}{|\mathbf{v}|_g |\mathbf{w}|_g}
$$

Tangent vector $\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\in T_\mathbf{p} M$ are *orthogonal* if $\langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \rangle_g = 0$. This means either on or both vectors are zero, or the angle between them is $\frac{\pi}{2}$.

<MathBox title='Existence of Riemannian metrics' boxType='proposition'>
Every smooth manifold with or without boundary admits a Riemannian metric.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and choose a covering of $M$ by smooth coordinate charts $(U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha)$. In each coordinate domain, there is a Riemannian metric $g_\alpha = \varphi_\alpha^* \overline{g}$, whose coordinate expression is $\delta_{ij}\;\mathrm{d}x^i\;\mathrm{d}x^j$. Let $\Set{\psi_\alpha}$ be a smooth partition on unity subordinate to the cover $\Set{U_\alpha}$, and define

$$
  g = \sum_\alpha \psi_\alpha g_\alpha
$$

with each term interpreted to be zero outside $\mathrm{supp}(\mathbf{psi}_\alpha)$. By local finiteness, there are only finitely many nonzero terms in a neighbourhood of each point, so this expression defines a smooth tensor field. It is obviously symmetric, so only positivity needs to be checked. If $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p} M$ is any nonzero vector, then

$$
  g_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}) = \sum_\alpha \psi_\alpha (\mathbf{p}) g_\alpha |_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{v})
$$

This sum is nonnegative, because each term is nonnegative. At least one of the functions $\psi_\alpha$ is strictly positive at $\mathbf{p}$, because they sum to $1$. Becuase $g_\alpha|_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}) > 0$, it follows that $g_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}) > 0$

If it is positive definite, it is a Riemannian metric on $M$, called the *pullback metric* determined by $F$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Pullback metric criterion' boxType='proposition'>

<MathBox title='Riemannian isometry' boxType='definition'>
If $(M,g)$ and $(\tilde{M},\tilde{g})$ are both Riemannian manifolds, a smooth map $F:M\to\tilde{M}$ is called a *(Riemannian) isometry* if it is a diffeomorphism that satisfies $F^*\tilde{g} = g$. More generally, $F$ is a *local isometry* if every point $\mathbf{p}\in M$ has a neighbourhood $U$ such that $F|_U$ is an isometry of $U$ onto an open subset of $\tilde{M}$; or equivalently, if $F$ is a local diffeomorphism satisfying $F*^\tilde{g} = g$.

If there exists a Riemannian isometry between $(M,g)$ and $(\tilde{M},\tilde{g})$, we say that they are *isometric* as Riemannian manifolds. If each point of $M$ has a neighbourhood that is isometric ot an open subset of $(\tilde{M},\tilde{g})$, we say that $(M,g)$ is *locally isometric* to $(\tilde{M},\tilde{g})$.

3. Each point of $M$ is contained in the domain of a smooth local coordinatee chart in which the coordinate frame is orthonormal.
4. Each point of $M$ is contained in the domain of a commuting orthonormal frame.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The implications **(1)** $\implies$ **(2)** $\implies$ **(3)** $\implies$ **(4)** are easy consequences of the definitions. The remaining implication **(4)** $\implies$ **(1)** follows from the canonical form theorem for commuting frames: if $(E_i)$ is a commuting orthonormal frame for $g$ on an open subset $U\subseteq M$, then each $\mathbf{p}\in V$ is contained in the domain of a smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ in which the coordiante frame is equal to $(E_i)$. This means $\varphi_* E_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$, so the diffeomorphism $\varphi: U\to\varphi(U)$ satisfies

$$
\begin{align*}
  \varphi^* \overline{g}(E_i, E_j) =& \oveline{g}(\varphi_* E_i, \varphi_* E_j) \\
  =& \overline{g}\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} \right) \\
  =& \delta_{ij} = g(E_i, E_j)
\end{align*}
$$

Bilinearity then shows that $\varphi^* \overline{g} = g$, so $\varphi$ is an isometry between $(U, g|_U)$ and $\varphi(U)$ with the Euclidean metric. This shows that $g$ is flat.

### Riemannian submanifolds

<MathBox title='Riemannian submanifold' boxType='definition'>
If $(M, g)$ is a Riemannian manifold with or without boundary, every submanifold $S\subseteq M$ (immersed or embedded, with or without boundary) automatically inherits a pullback metric $\iota^* g$, where $\iota: S\hookrightarrow M$ is inclusion. In this setting, the pullback metric is called the *induced metric* on $S$. By definition, this mean that for $\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}\in T_\mathbf{p} S$ That

$$
\begin{align*}
  (\iota^* g)(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}) =& g(\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v}), \mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{w})) \\
  =& g(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w})
\end{align*}
$$

because $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p}S \to T_\mathbf{p}M$ is the usual identification of $T_\mathbf{p} S$ as a subspace of $T_\mathbf{p} M$. This $\iota^* g$ is just the restriction of $g$ to pairs of vectors tangent to $S$. With this metric $S$ is a *Riemannian submanifold* of $M$.

<MathBox title='Flatness criterion for surfaces of revolution' boxType='proposition'>
Let $C\subseteq H$ be a connected embedded $1$-dimensional submanifold of the half-plane $H = \Set{(r,z): r > 0}$, and let $S_C$ be the surface of revolution generated by $C$. The induced metric on $S_C$ is flat if and only if $C$ is part of a straight line.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

To compute the induced metric on $S_C$, choose any smooth local parametrization $\gamma(t) = (a(t), b(t))$ for $C$, and note that the map $X(t,\theta) = (a(t)\cos\theta, a(t)\sin\theta, b(t))$ yields a smooth local parametrization of $S_C$, provided that $(t,\theta)$ is restricted to a sufficiently small open subset of the plane. Thus, we can compute

$$
\begin{align*}
  X^* \overline{g} =& \mathrm{d}(a(t)\cos\theta)^2 + \mathrm{d}(a(t)\sin\theta)^2 + \mathrm{d}(b(t))^2 \\
  =& (a'(t)\cos\theta\;\mathrm{d}t - a(t) \sin\theta \;\mathrm{d}\theta)^2 \\
  &+ (a'(t)\sin\theta \;\mathrm{d}t + a(t)\cos\theta \;\mathrm{d}\theta)^2 + (b'(t)\mathrm{d}t)^2 \\
  =& (a'(t)^2 + b'(t)^2)\mathrm{d}t^2 + a(t)^2 \mathrm{d}\theta^2
\end{align*}
$$

In particular if $\gamma$ is a unit-speed curve, meaning that $|\gamma'(t)|^2 = a'(t)^2 + b'(t)^2 = 1$, this reduces to

$$
  X^* \overline{g} =& \mathrm{d}t^2 + a(t)^2 \mathrm{d}\theta^2
$$

First assume that $C$ is part of a straight line. Then it has a parametrization of the form $\gamma(t) = (Pt + K, Qt + L)$ for some constants $P$, $Q$, $K$ and $L$ with $P$ and $Q$ not both zero. By rescaling $t$, we may assume that $\gamma$ is unit speed, i.e. $|\gamma'(t)|^2 = 1$. If $Q = 1$, then $S_C$ is an open subset of the plane $z = L$ and is therefore flat. If $P = 0$, then $S_C$ is an opne subset of the plane $z = L$ and is therefore flat. If $P = 0$, then $S_C$ is part of the cylinder $x^2 + y^2 = K^2$. Dividing by $K^2$ and writing $\tilde{x} = x/K$ and $\tilde{y} = y/K$, we get the unit cylinder $\tilde{x}^2 + \tilde{y}^2 = 1$. The induced metric becomes $\mathrm{d}t^2 + \mathrm{d}\theta^2$, which is the Euclidean metric on the $(t,\theta)$-plane and is therefore flat.

If neither $P$ nor $Q$ is zero, then $S_C$ is part of a cone with induced metric $\mathrm{d}^2 (Pt + K)^2 \mathrm{d}\theta^2$. In an neighbourhood of any point, the change of coordinates $(u, v) = ((t + K/P)\cos(P\theta), (t + K/P)\sin(P\theta))$ pulls the Euclidean metric $\mathrm{d}u^2 + \mathrm{d}v^2$ back to $\mathrm{d}^t + (Pt + K)^2 \mathrm{d}\theta^2$, so this metric is flat.

Conversely, assuming that $S_C$ is flat, we will show that $C$ is part of a straight line. Let $\gamma(t) = (a(t), b(t))$ be a local parametrization of $C$. Assuming that $\gamma$ is unit-speed, i.e. $a'(t)^2 + b'(t)^2 = 1$, the induced metric is $\mathrm{d}t^2 + a^2 \mathrm{d}\theta^2$. Thus, the local frame $(E_1,E_2)$ is given by

$$
  E_1 = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\quad E_2 = \frac{1}{a}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}
$$

is orthonormal. Any orthonormal fram $(\tilde{E}_1,\tilde{E}_2)$ can be written in the form

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{E}_1 =& uE_1 + vE_2 = u\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \frac{v}{a}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} \\
  \pm\tilde{E}_2 =& vE_1 - uE_2 = v\frac{\partial}{\partial t} - \frac{u}{a}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} 
\end{align*}
$$

for some functions $u$ and $v$ depending smoothly on $(t,\theta)$ and satisfying $u^2 + v^2 = 1$. Because the metric is flat, it is possible to choose $u$ and $v$ such that $(\tilde{E}_1, \tilde{E}_2)$ is a commuting orthonormal frame. Expressing in terms of Lie brackets, we get

$$
\begin{align*}
  0 = \pm [\tilde{E}_1, \tilde{E}_2] =& \left(u\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + \frac{v}{a}\frac{\partial v}{\partial\theta} \right)\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \\
  &- \left( u\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\frac{u}{a}) + \frac{v}{a}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}(\frac{u}{a}) \right)\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} \\
  &- \left(v\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - \frac{u}{a}\frac{\partial u}{\partial\theta} \right)\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \\
  &- \left( v\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\frac{v}{a}) - \frac{u}{a}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}(\frac{v}{a}) \right)\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}
\end{align*}
$$

To simplify notation, we write $f_\theta = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}$ and $f_t = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ for any function $f$. Note that $u^2 + v^2 = 1$ implies that $uu_\theta + vv_\theta = uu_t + vv_t = 0$, and the fact that $a$ only depend on $t$ implies $a_\theta = 0$ and $a_t = a'$. Inserting these relations and simplifying gives

$$
  0 = (uv_t - vu_t)\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \left(\frac{a' - vu_\theta + uv_\theta}{a^2} \right)\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}
$$

which implies That

$$
\begin{align*}
  uv_t - vu_t =& 0 \\
  vu_\theta - uv_\theta = a'
\end{align*}
$$

Because $u^2 + v^2 \equiv 1$, each point has a neighbourhood on which either $u$ or $v$ is nonzero. On any open subset where $v\neq 0$, then the $t$-derivative of $u/v$ zero. This we can write $u = fv$, where $f$ is some function of $\theta$ alone. Then $u^2 + v^2 = 1$ implies that $v^2 (f^2 + 1) = 1$, so $v = \pm 1 / \sqrt{f^2 + 1}$ is also a function of $\theta$ alone, and so is $u = \pm\sqrt{1 - v^2}$. A similar argument applies where $u \neq 0$. Then it follows that $a'$ is independent of $t$, making it a constant, and consequently so is $b' = \pm\sqrt{1 - (a')^2}$. It follows that $a$ and $b$ are affine functions of $t$, so each point of $C$ has a neighbourhood contained in a straight line. Since we are assuming that $C$ is connected, it follows that all of $C$ is contained in a single straight line.
