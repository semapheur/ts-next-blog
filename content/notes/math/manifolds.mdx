# Topological space

Topological spaces are an abstraction of metric spaces. 

<MathBox title='Topological space' boxType='definition'>
Let $X$ be a set with power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$. A topology on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ of subsets of $X$, called open subsets, satisfying

1. $\emptyset, X \in \mathcal{T}$
2. $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under arbitrary union: $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}\implies\bigcup A \in \mathcal{T}$
3. $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under finite intersection: $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T} \land \mathcal{A}\text{ is finite } \implies \bigcap \mathcal{A} \in \mathcal{T}$

The pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called a topological space. A subset $C\subseteq X$ is called closed in $(X,\mathcal{T})$ if its complement is open, i.e. $X\setminus C \in\mathcal{T}$. Note that $X$ and $\emptyset$ are both open and closed.
</MathBox>

A topology can similarly be constructed from collections of closed sets, as captured in the following proposition.

<MathBox title='Closed set topology' boxType='proposition'>
Given a set $X$, then $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ is the collection of closed sets for a topology on $X$ iff

1. $\emptyset, X \in \mathcal{X}$
2. $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under arbitrary intersection: $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C}\implies\bigcap A \in \mathcal{C}$
3. $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under finite union: $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C} \land \mathcal{A}\textrm{ is finite } \implies \bigcup \mathcal{A} \in \mathcal{C}$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Note that $\mathcal{T} = \Set{U^c | U\in\mathcal{C}}$ defines a collection of open sets that satsify the axioms of a topology
1. since $\emptyset, X\in\mathcal{T}$ and $\emptyset = X^c$, then $\emptyset, X\in\mathcal{C}$
2. for an arbitrary collection $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$ we know that $\bigcup\mathcal{A}\in\mathcal{T}$. Taking the complement of the union and applying DeMorgan's law gives
$$
  \left( \bigcup\mathcal{A} \right)^c &= \bigcap \Set{ A^c | A\in\mathcal{A} } \in\mathcal{C}
$$
3. for an arbitrary collection $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, then $\bigcup\mathcal{A}\in\mathcal{T}$. Noting that $\mathcal{A}^c = \Set{A^c | A\in\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$. Applying DeMorgan's law shows that $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under arbitrary intersection
$$
  \left( \bigcup\mathcal{A} \right)^c = \bigcap \Set{ A^c | A\in\mathcal{A} } = \bigcap \mathcal{A}^c \in\mathcal{C}
$$
4. for a finite collection $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, then $\bigcap\mathcal{A}\in\mathcal{T}$. Noting that $\mathcal{A}^c = \Set{A^c | A\in\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$. Applying DeMorgan's law shows that $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under finite union
$$
  \left( \bigcap\mathcal{A} \right)^c = \bigcup \Set{ A^c | A\in\mathcal{A} } = \bigcup \mathcal{A}^c \in\mathcal{C}
$$

<MathBox title='Neighbourhood' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a point $x\in X$. A neighbourhood of $x$ is a subset $V\subseteq X$ that includes an open set $U\subseteq X$ containing $x$, i.e.

$$
  x \in U\subseteq V\subseteq X
$$

The neighbourhood $V$ need not be open.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proposition' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space. A set $U\subseteq X$ is open if and only if $U$ is a neighbourhood of every $x\in U$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $U$ is open, then it is clearly a neighbourhood of every $x\in U$. Conversely, suppose $U$ is a neighbourhood of every $x\in U$. Then by definition, for every $x\in U$ there is an open set $\x \in U_x \subseteq U$. Then $\bigcup_{x\in U} U_x = U$ is also open.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Closure' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. The closure of $S$, denoted $\mathrm{cl}(S) \equiv \overline{S}$ is the intersection of all closed subsets of $X$ containing $S$

$$
  \overline{S} := \Set{\bigcap C \subseteq X | C\textrm{ is closed and }S\subseteq C }
$$

This is the smallest closed set containing $S$.
1. $\overline{S}$ is closed
2. $S\subseteq\overline{S}$
3. if $C$ is closed and $S\subseteq C$ then $\overline{S}\subseteq C$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Interior' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. Then $p\in S$ is called an interior point of $S$ if and only if there is an open set $U\in\mathcal{T}$ such that $p\in U$ and $U \subseteq S$. The interior of $S$, denoted $\mathrm{int}(S) \equiv S^0$, is the set of all interior points of $S$. Equivalently, $\mathrm{Int}(S)$, is defined as the union of all open subsets of $X$ contained in $S$.

$$
  \mathrm{int}(S) := \Set{\bigcup U\subseteq X | U\textrm{ is open and }U\subseteq S }
$$

This set is the largest open subset of $S$:
1. $\mathrm{int}(S)$ is open
2. $\mathrm{int}(S)\subseteq S$
3. if $U$ is open and $U\subseteq S$, then $U\subseteq\mathrm{int}(S)$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Exterior' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. Then $p\in S$ is called an extorior point of $S$ if and only if there is an open set $U \in \mathcal{T}$ such that $p \in U$ and $U \subseteq X\setminus S$. The extorior of $S$, denoted $\mathrm{ext}(S)$, is the set of all extorior points of $S$. Equivalently, $\mathrm{ext}(S)$ is the is the union of all open subsets of $X$ contained in $X \setminus S$, i.e. disjoint from $S$.

$$
  \mathrm{ext}(S) := \Set{\bigcup U\subseteq X | U\textrm{ is open and }U\subseteq X\setminus S }
$$

This is the largest open set disjoint from $S$. The exterior is the interior of of the complement of $S$

$$
  \mathrm{ext}(S) = \mathrm{int}(X\setminus S) = X\setminus\overline{S}
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Boundary' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. Then $p\in S$ is called a boundary point of $S$ if and only if for all open sets $U \in \mathcal{T}$ with $p \in U$ then $U \cap S \neq \emptyset$ and $U \cap (X\setminus S) \neq \emptyset$. The boundary of $S$, denoted $\partial S$, is the set off all boundary points of $S$. Equivalently

$$
  \partial S := \overline{S}\setminus\mathrm{int}(S)
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Derived set' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. Then $p\in S$ is an accumulation point of $S$ if and only if for all open sets $U \in \mathcal{T}$ with $p \in U$ then $U\setminus \Set{ p } \cap S \neq \emptyset$. The derived set of $S$, denoted $S'$, is the set of all accumulation points of $S$.
</MathBox>

## Partial order

<MathBox title='Topological partial order' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $X$ is a set, and that $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are topologies on $X$. If $\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{T}$ is finer than $\mathcal{S}$, and $\mathcal{S}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}$. *Coarser than* ($\subseteq$) defines a partial order on the collection of topologies on $X$. That is, if $\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{T}$ are topologies on $X$, then this partial order has the following properties
1. reflexivity: $\mathcal{R}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{R}$
2. anti-symmetry: if $\mathcal{R}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{S}$, and $\mathcal{S}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{R}$, then $\mathcal{R} = \mathcal{S}$
3. transitivity: if $\mathcal{R}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ is coarser that $\mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{R}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}$
</MathBox>

## Separation

Separation properties refer to the ability to separate points or sets with disjoint open sets. Separated spaces are known as Hausdorff spaces.

<MathBox title='Hausdorff space (separated space)' boxType='definition'>
A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called a Hausdorff space if for every pair of distinct points $p, q \in X$, there exist disjoint open subsets $U, V \subseteq X$, ie. $U \cap V = \emptyset$ such that $p \in U$ and $q \in V$. A Hausdorff space guarantees the uniqueness of limits of sequences.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Regular space' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A closed set $A\subseteq X$ and a point $x\in A^c$ can be separated if there exist disjoint open sets $U, V\in\mathcal{T}$ with $A\subseteq U$ and $x\in V$. If every nonempty closed set $A$ and point $x\in A^c$ can be separated, then $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called a regular space. 
</MathBox>

## Basis

<MathBox title='Base' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A collection of open subsets $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$ is called a basis (base) of $\mathcal{T}$ if every set in $\mathcal{T}$ can be written as a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$

$$
  \forall T\in\mathcal{T}: \bigcup_{i \in I} B_i \subseteq\mathcal{B} = T
$$

where $I$ is an index set.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Base properties' boxType='proposition'>
Let $X$ be a nonempty set. A collection of open subsets $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a base for a topology on $X$ iff
1. $X = \bigcup\mathcal{B}$
2. if $A,B\in\mathcal{B}$ and $x\in A\cap B$, there exists $C\in\mathcal{B}$ with $x\in C\subseteq A\cap B$

The second condition can be more weakly stated as
2. if $A, B\in\mathcal{B}$, then $A\cap B\in\mathcal{B}$
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $\mathcal{B}$ is a base for a topology on $X$. Since $X$ is open, $X$ is a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$. Since every set in $\mathcal{B}$ is a subset of $X$, we must have $X=\bigcup\mathcal{B}$. Suppose that $A,B\in\mathcal{B}$ and that $x\in A\cap B$. Since $A\cap B$ is open, it's a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$. The point $x$ must be in one of those sets, so there exists $C\in\mathcal{B}$ with $x\in C\subseteq A\cap B$.
</details>
</MathBox>

A neighbourhood basis at $p \in X$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}_p$ of neighbourhoods of $p$ such that every neighbourhood of $p$ contains at least one $B \in \mathcal{B}_p$.

A topological set $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is first-countable if there is a countable neighbourhood basis at each point, and second-countable if there is a countable basis of $\mathcal{T}$. Since a countable basis of $\mathcal{T}$ contains a countable neighbourhood basis at each point, second-countability implies first-countability. A set is called countable if it admits a bijection with the set of natural numbers.

### Examples

For a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ induced by a metric $(X, d)$, the basis of $\mathcal{T}$ is

$$
  \mathcal{B} = \Set{ B_\varepsilon (x) | x \in X, \, \varepsilon > 0 }
$$

## Compactness (finite covers)

<MathBox title='Cover' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A cover of $X$ is a collection of subsets $\mathcal{C} = \Set{ U_i }_{i\in I}$, for some index set $I$, whose union is the whole space $X$, i.E

$$
  \bigcup \mathcal{C} = \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i = X
$$

The collection $\mathcal{C}$ is said to cover a subspace $A\subseteq X$ if

$$
  A \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{C} = \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i
$$

We call $\mathcal{C}$ an open cover if all its members are open subsets, i.e. $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, and we call $\mathcal{C}$ a closed cover if all its members are closed subsets. A subcover of $\mathcal{C}$ is a subset of $\mathcal{C}$ that still covers $X$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Compact set' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A subset $C\subseteq X$ is called compact if any open cover of $C$ has a finite subcover. That is, if $\mathcal{A}\in\mathcal{T}$ covers $C$, i.e. with $C\subseteq\bigcap\mathcal{A}$, there exists a finite $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{A}$ with $C\subseteq\mathcal{B}$. Alternatively, any infinite collection of open sets that together cover a compact set, always overcovers it. A topological space $X$ is locally compact if every point $x\in X$ has a compact neighbourhood.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proposition' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $C\subseteq X$ be compact. If $B\subseteq C$ is closed, then $B$ is also compact.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $\mathcal{A}$ is an open cover of $B$. Since $B$ is closed, then $B^c$ is open, so $\mathcal{A}\cup \Set{B^c}$ is an open cover of $C$. Since $C$ is compact, this last collection has a finite subcover of $C$, which is also a finite subscover of $B$. Hence $B$ is also compact.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Compactness is preserved under finite unions' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $C_i \subseteq X$ be compact for each $i$ in a finite index set $I$. Then $C = \bigcup_{i\in I} C_i$ is compact.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $\mathcal{A}$ is an open cover of $C$. Trivially, $\mathcal{A}$ is also an open cover of $C_i$ for each $i\in I$. Hence there exists a finite subcover $\mathcal{A}_i \subseteq\mathcal{A}$ of $C_i$ for each $i\in I$. Then $\bigcup_{i\in I} \mathcal{A}_i$ is also a finite cover of $C$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Compactness properties of Hausdorff spaces' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a Hausdorff space, then the following properties hold
1. if $C\subseteq X$ is compact, then $C$ is closed, ie. $C^c = X \setminus C \in \mathcal{T}$
2. if $x\in X$, $C\subseteq X$ is compact, and $x\notin C$, then there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ with $x\in U$ and $C\subseteq V$
3. if $x\in X$ and $A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ with $\partial A$ compact, then there exists a closed neighbourhood $B$ of $x$ with $B\subseteq A$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** We will show that $C^c = X\setminus C$ is open, so fix $x\in C^c$. Since $C$ is Hausdorff, each $y\in C$ can be separated from $x$, meaning there are disjoint open sets $U_y, V_y\in\mathcal{T}$ with $x\in U_y$ and $y\in V_y$. Trivially, the collection $\Set{ V_y | y\in C}$ form an open cover of $C$

$$
  C \subseteq \bigcup_{y \in C} V_y
$$

Since $C$ is compact, it has a finite subscover and hence there is a finite subset $B\subseteq C$ such that $\Set{ V_y | y\in B }$ covers $C$. But then $U = \bigcap_{y\in B} U_y$ is open (since $B$ is finite) and disjoint from $\bigcup_{y\in B} V_y$. Thus, $U$ is also disjoint from $C$. To summarize, $U$ is open and $x\in U\subseteq C^c$

**(2):** For each $y\in C$ there exist disjoint open sets $U_y$ and $V_y$ with $x\in U_y$ and $y\in V_y$. Trivially, the collection $\Set{V_y | y\in C}$ is an open cover of $C$, and by compactness there exists a finite subset $B\subseteq C$ such that $\Set{V_y | y\in B}$ covers $C$. Thus, let $U = \bigcap_{y\in B} U_y$ and $V = \bigcup_{y\in B} V_y$. Then $U$ is open, since $B$ is finite, and $V$ is open. Moreover $U$ and $V$ are disjoint, and $x\in U$ and $C\subseteq V$.

**(3):** By property $(2)$, there exists disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ with $x\in U$ and $\partial A\subseteq V$. Hence $\overline{U}$ and $\partial A$ are disjoint. Let $B = \overline{A\cap U}$. Note that $B$ is closed, and is a neighbourhood of $x$ since $U$ and $A$ are neighbourhoods of $x$. Moreover

$$
\begin{align*}
  B &\subseteq \overline{A}\cap\overline{U} \\
  &= [A\cup \partial A]\cap\overline{U} \\
  &= [A\cap\overline{U}] \cup \underbrace{[\partial A \cap\overline{U}]}_{=\emptyset} \\
  &= A\cap\overline{U} \subseteq A
\end{align*}
$$
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Compactness properties of Hausdorff spaces' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. If $x\in X$ and $A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, then there exists a compact neighbourhood $B$ of $x$ with $B\subseteq A$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Since $X$ is locally compact, there exists a compact neighbourhood $C$ of $x$. Hence $A\cap C$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Moreover, $\partial(A\cap C)\subseteq C$ is closed and hence compact. We know that there exists a closed neighbourhood $B$ of $x$ with $B\subseteq A\cap C$. Since $B$ is closed and $B\subseteq C$, it is also compact. Additionally we have $B\subseteq A$.  
</details>
</MathBox>

## Connectivity

<MathBox title='Connected and disconnected spaces' boxType='definition'>
A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is disconnected if there exists two disjoint nonempty open subsets $A, B \subseteq X$ such that $X = A \cup B$ and $\overline{A}\cap B = A \cap \overline{B} = \emptyset$. Otherwise $X$ is connected, which is equivalently true if and only if the only subsets of $X$ that are both open and closed are $\emptyset$ and $X$ itself.
</MathBox>

A connected subset of $X$ is a subset that is connected space when endowed with the subspace topology. A maximal connected subset of $X$ (that is not containing in any larger connected subset) is called a (connected) component of $X$. 

<MathBox title='Path-connected spaces' boxType='definition'>
A path in $X$ from $p \in X$ to $q \in X$ is a continuous map $f: I = [0, 1] \to X$ such that $f(0) = p$ and $f(1) = q$. If there exists a path in $X$ for every pair $p, q \in X$, then $X$ is path-connected. The path components of $X$ are its maximal path-connected subsets.

The topological space $X$ is locally path-connected if $X$ has a basis of path-connected open subsets.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of (path-)connected spaces' boxType='definition'>
Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces.
1. If $F:X \to Y$ is continuous and $X$ is connected, then $F(X)$ is also connected.
2. Every connected subset of $X$ is contained in a single component of $X$.
3. A union of connected subspaces of $X$ with a point in common is connected.
4. The components of $X$ are disjoint nonempty closed subsets whose union is $X$, and thus they form a partition of $X$.
5. If $S \subseteq X$ is both open and closed, then $S$ is a union of components of $X$.
6. Every finite product of connected spaces is connected.
7. Every quotient space of a connected space is connected.
</MathBox>

A topological space is locally path-connected if it admits a basis of path-connected open subsets.

<MathBox title='Properties of locally path-connected spaces' boxType='definition'>
Let $X$ be a topological space.
1. The components of $X$ are open in $X$.
2. The path components of $X$ are equal to its components.
3. $X$ is connected if and only if it is path-connected.
4. Every open subset of $X$ is locally path-connected.
</MathBox>

## Countability axioms

<MathBox title='Dense set' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space. A set $D\subseteq X$ is dense if $U\subseteq D$ is nonempty for every nonempty $U\subseteq\mathcal{T}$. Equivalently, $D$ is dense if every neighbourhood of a point $x\in X$ contains an element of $D$. A set $S$ is said to be nowhere dense in $X$ if $\overline{S}$ contains no nonempty open subset.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proposition' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space. A set $D\subseteq X$ is dense if and only if $\overline{D} = X$
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $D$ is dense. Since $\overline{D}$ is closed, then $\overline{D}^c$ is open. If this set is nonempty, it must contain a point in $D$. This is a constradiction since $D\subseteq\overline{D}$. Conversely, suppose that $\overline{D} = X$, and suppose that $U$ is a nonempty open set. Then $U^c$ is closed and $U^c \neq X$. If $D\cap U = \emptyset$, then $D\subseteq U^c$. But then $\overline{D}\subseteq U^c$ so $\overline{D}\neq X$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Countability axioms' boxType='axiom'>
A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is called
1. *separable* if there exists a countable dense subset
2. *first-countable* if each point $x\in X$ has a countable neighbourhood basis
3. *second-countable* if the topology $\mathcal{T}$ has a countable base
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Countability relations' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X,\mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, then the following properties hold
1. if $X$ is second countable, then it is separable
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Suppose that $\mathcal{B} = \Set{U_i}_{i\in I}$ is a base for $\mathcal{T}$, where $I$ is a countable index set. Select $x_i\in U_i$ for each $i\in I$, and let $D = \Set{ x_i }_{i\in I}$, which is clearly countable. If $U$ is open and nonempty, then $U = \bigcup_{j\in J} U_j$ for some $J\subseteq I$. But then $\Set{x_j }_{j\in J} \subseteq U$, so $D$ is dense.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $X$ be a second-countable topological space. Every open cover of $X$ has a countable subcover.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a countable basis for $X$, and let $\mathcal{U}$ be an arbitrary open cover of $X$. Let $\mathcal{B}' \subseteq\mathcal{B}$ be the collection of basis open subsets $B\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $B\subseteq U$ for some $U\in\mathcal{U}$. For each $B\in\mathcal{B}'$, choose a particular set $U_B \in\mathcal{U}$ containing $B$. The collection $\Set{U_B | B\in\mathcal{B}'}$ is countable, so it suffices to show that it covers $X$. Given a point $B\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B\subseteq V$. This implies, in particular, that $B\in\mathcal{B}'$ and therefore $x\in B\subseteq U_B$.
</details>
</MathBox>

## Convergence

<MathBox title='Convergent sequence' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A sequence $\left( x_n \in X \right)_{n \in \N}$ of points in $X$ is said to converge to a point $x\in X$, if and only if for each neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ there is a $N \in \N$ such that $x_n \in U$ for all $n \geq N$. This convergence is denoted $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} x$.
</MathBox>

Unlike metric spaces, where neighbourhoods can be made arbitrarily small, the limit of a sequence in a topological space is not necessarily unique. This is only the case if points in the space can be separated, meaning that the space is Hausdorff.

<MathBox title='Uniqueness of limits' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a Hausdorff space. If $\left( x_n \in X \right)_{n\in\N}$ is a sequence of points in $X$ with $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} x$ and $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} y$, then $x = y$.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $x\neq y$, there exists disjoint neighbourhoods $A$ and $B$ of $x$ and $y$, respectively. There exist $M, N \in\N$ such that $x_n \in A$ for all $n \geq M$ and $x_n \in B$ for all $n\geq N$. However, if $n \geq\max\Set{M, N}$, then $x_n \in A$ and $x_n \in B$, giving a contradiction.
</details>
</MathBox>

## Continuity

Continuity of functions is one of the most important concepts of topology. The idea is that if two points are close together in the domain, the functional values should be close together in the range. In topology, this is expressed through preservation of openness between the domain and range spaces. A continuous function has the property that the preimage of an open set (in the range space) is also open (in the domain space).

<MathBox title='Open function' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces. A map $f: X \to Y$ is called open if it sends open sets $A \subseteq X$ to open sets $f[A] \subseteq Y$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Continuous function' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces. A function $f: X\to Y$ is continuous if $f^{-1}[U]\in\mathcal{T}_X$ is open for every open $U \in\mathcal{T}_Y$. The function $f$ is locally continuous at a point $x\in X$ if $f^{-1}[B]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ whenever $B$ is a neigbourhood of $f(x)\in Y$. Given a subset $A\subseteq X$, the function $f$ is continuous on $A$ if $f$ is continuous at each $x\in A$.

If $f$ is bijective and $f^{-1}: Y \to X$ is continuous, then $f$ is also open. The continuity of $f^{-1}$ implies that for all open sets $A \subseteq X$, then $\left( f^{-1} \right)^{-1}[A] = f[A] \subseteq Y$ is also open.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proposition' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be two topoligical spaces. A function $f: X\to Y$ is continuous if and only if $f$ is continuous at each $x\in X$.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $f$ is continuous. Let $x\in X$ and let $B$ be a neigbourhood of $f(x)$. Then there exists an open set $V\subseteq T$ with $f(x)\in V\subseteq B$. However, then $f^{-1}[V]\in\mathcal{T}_X$ is open in $X$, and $x\in f^{-1}[V]\subseteq f^{-1}[B]$, so $f^{-1}[B]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Hence $f$ is continuous at $x$.

Conversely, suppose that $f$ is continuous at each $x\in X$, and suppose that $V\in\mathcal{T}_Y$. If $V$ contains no points in the range of $f$, then $f^{-1}[V] = \emptyset\in\mathcal{T}_X$. Otherwise, there exists $x\in X$ with $f(x)\in V$. However, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of $f(x)$, so $U = f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Let $y\in U$. Then $f(y)\in V$ also, so $U$ is also a neighbourhood of $y$, hence $U\in\mathcal{T}$.

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be two topoligical spaces, and consider a continuous function $f: X\to Y$. If $\left( x_n \in X \right)_{n\in\N}$ is a sequence of points in $X$ with $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} x$, then $f(x_n) \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} f(x)$.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $V\subseteq Y$ with $f(x)\in V$. Then $f^{-1}[V]$ is open in $X$ and $x\in f^{-1}[V]$. Hence there exists $N\in\N$ such that $x_n \in f^{-1}[V]$ for every $n\geq M$. However, then $f(x_n)\in V$ for every $n\geq N$ meaning $f(x_n) \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} f(x)$.

<MathBox title='Composition preserves continuity' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$, $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ and $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$ be three topoligical spaces. If $f: X\to Y$ and $g: Y\to Z$ are continuous, then $g\circ f: X\to Z$ is continuous.

If $A$ is open in $Z$, then $g^{-1}[A]$ is open in $Y$ and therefore $f^{-1}\left[g^{-1}[A] \right] = \left(f^{-1}\circ g^{-1} \right)(A)$ is open in $X$. Noting $(g\circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}$.

<MathBox title='Continuity is local' boxType='lemma'>
Continuity is a local property in the following sense: if $F:X\to Y$ is a map between topological spaces such that every point $p\in X$ has a neighbourhood $U$ on which the restriction $F|_U$ is continuous, then $F$ is continuous.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Gluing lemma for continuous maps' boxType='lemma'>
Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, and suppose that one of the following conditions holds:
1. $B_1,\dots,B_n$ are finitely many closed subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$
2. $\Set{B_i}_{i\in A}$ is a collection of open subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$

Suppose that for all $i$ we are given continuous maps $F_i:B_i\to Y$ that agree on overlaps, i.e. $F_i|_{B_i \cap B_j} = F_j|_{B_i \cap B_j}$. Then there exists a unique continuous map $F:X\to Y$ whose restriction to each $B_i$ is equal to $F_i$. 
</MathBox>

### Homeomorphism

<MathBox title='Homeomorphism' boxType='definition'>
Given two topological spaces $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$, a continuous bijection $f: X \mapsto Y$ with a continuous inverse is called a homeomorphism. When such a function exists, the topoligical spaces $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic. A continuous map is called a local homeomorphism if every point $p \in X$ has a neighbourhood $U \subseteq X$ such that $f(U)$ is open in $Y$ and $f$ restricts to a homeomorphism from $U$ to $f(U)$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of homeomorphisms' boxType='proposition'>
For topological spaces $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$, $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ and $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$, then
1. $X$ is homeomorphic to $X$ (reflexivity)
2. if $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$, then $Y$ is homeomorphic to $X$ (symmetry)
3. if $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$, and $Y$ is homeomorphic to $Z$, then $X$ is homeomorphic to $Z$ (transitivity)
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

1. The identity function $\mathrm{id}: X\to X$ defined by $\mathrm{id}(x) = x$ for $x\in S$ is a homeomorphism from $S$ to itself.
2. If $f: X\to Y$ is a homeomorphism from $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ to $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$, then $f$ is continuous bijection and hence $f^{-1}: Y\to X$ is a homeomorphism from $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ to $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$.
3. If $f: X\to Y$ is a homeomorphism from $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ to $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$, and $g: Y\to Z$ is homeomorphism from $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ to $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$, then $g\circ f: X\to Z$ is homemorphism from $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ to $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$.
</details>
</MathBox>

### Sequential continuity

A map $f: X \mapsto Y$ is called sequential continuous if for all $x \in X$ such that $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \N}$ with $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} x$, then $\left( f(x_n) \right)_{n \in \mathcal{N}} \subseteq Y$ is convergent with $f(x_n) \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} f(x)$.

## Subspace

A subspace of the topological space $(X, \mathcal{U})$ is a subset $A \subseteq X$ with the topology given by $\Set{ A \cap U | U \in \mathcal{U} }$

## Product topology

<MathBox title='Product topology' boxType='definition'>
Let $\Set{ \left(X_i, \mathcal{T}_{i}\right) }_{i\in I}$ be a collection of topological spaces, where $I$ is an index set. The product space denoted $\prod_{i\in I} (X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)$ consists of the product space $\prod_{i\in I} X_i$ with a topology given by the basis

$$
  \mathcal{B} := \Set{ \prod_{i\in I} U_i | U_i \in\mathcal{T}_i \textrm{ and }U_i = X_i \textrm{ for all but a finite number of }i\in I }
$$
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Trivially, $\prod_{i\in I} X_i = \bigcup\mathcal{B}$. Given $\prod_{i\in I} A_i \in\mathcal{B}$, $\prod_{i\in I} B_i \in\mathcal{B}$, then 

$$
  \left($\prod_{i\in I} A_i \in\mathcal{B}$\right) \cap \left( $\prod_{i\in I} B_i \in\mathcal{B}$ \right) = \prod_{i, j \in I} A_i \cap B_j \in\mathcal{B}
$$

Hence, $\mathcal{B}$ is a well defined base for the product topology.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Projections are continuous' boxType='proposition'>
Let $\prod_{i\in I} (X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)$ be a product space. The projections $p_j : \prod_{i\in I} (X_i,\mathcal{T}_i)\to X_j$ defined by $p_j (x) = x_j$ are continuous functions.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $U$ is open in $X_j$, then $p_j^{-1}[U] = \prod_{i\in I} A_i$ where $A_i = X_i$ for $i\in I$ with $i\neq j$ and $A_j = U$, so this preimage is open in the product space.
</details>
</MathBox>

## Quotient space

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and consider an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $X$. The quotient space wrt to the equivalence relation is the set $X/{\sim}$ with the quotient topology.

An equivalence on the set $X$ is a subset $E$ of the set $X \times X = \Set{ \left( x_1, x_2 \right) | x_1, x_2 \in X }$ satisfying

1. reflexivity: $\left( x, x \right) \in E \, \forall x \in E$ or $x \sim x$
2. symmetry: $\left( x, y \right) \in E \Rightarrow \left( y, x \right)$ or $x \sim y \implies y \sim x$
3. transivity: If $\left( x, y \right) \in E$ and $\left( y, z \right) \in E$ then $\left( x, z \right) \in E$, or $x \sim y \wedge y \sim x \implies x \sim z$

If $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $X$, then for each $x \in X$, the equivalence class of $x$ is defined as the subset 

$$
  [x]_\sim := \Set{ y \in X | x \sim y }
$$

The set of all equivalence classes is a partition of $X$ into a collection of nonempty, mutually disjoint subsets, defined as 

$$
  X /{\sim} := \Set{ [x]_\sim | x \in X }
$$

Given the surjective quotient map $p: X \mapsto X /{\sim}$ with $x \mapsto [x]_\sim$, commonly known as a canonical projection. The quotient topology $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ on $X / \sim$ is defined by declaring a subset $U \subseteq X /{\sim}$ to be open if and only if $p^{-1}[U] \subset X$ is open, ie.

$$
  p^{-1} [U] \in \mathcal{T} \iff U \in \hat{\mathcal{T}}
$$

### Projective space

A projective space $P^n (\R)$ is the set  of 1-dimensional subspaces of $\R^{n+1}$. It is defined as the quotient space $P^n := S^n / \sim$ with the equivalence relation $x \sim y :\iff (x = y \textrm{ or } x = -y)$ and where 

$$
  S^n := \Set{ x \in \R^{n+1} \,|\, \lVert x \rVert = 1 }
$$

is the $n$-dimensional sphere. To show that $P^n (\R)$ is a Hausdorff space we consider $[x]_\sim , [y]_\sim \in P^n (\R)$ with $[x]_\sim \neq [y]_\sim$. We then take the open neighbourhoods $U, V \in S^n$ of $x$ and $y$ respectively with

$$
\begin{aligned}
  U \cap V &= \emptyset \\
  -U \cap -V &= \emptyset 
\end{aligned}\quad
\begin{aligned}
  -U \cap V &= \emptyset \\
  U \cap -V &= \emptyset 
\end{aligned}
$$

Considering $\hat{U}:= q[u]$ where $q: S^n \mapsto S^n / \sim$ is the canonical projection. Taking the preimage we see that 

$$
  q^{-1}\left[\hat{U}\right] = U \cup -U \in \mathcal{T} \implies \hat{U} \in \hat{\mathcal{T}}
$$

hence, $\hat{U}$ is open. In the same manner it can be shown that $\hat{V}:= q[v] \in \hat{\mathcal{T}}$ is open. We can now show that

$$
  q^{-1}\left[ \hat{U} \cap \hat{V} \right] = q^{-1}\left[\hat{U}\right] \cap q^{-1}\left[\hat{V}\right] = (U \cup -U) \cap (V \cup -V) = \emptyset
$$

since $q$ is surjective we conclude that $\hat{U} \cap \hat{V} = \emptyset$ which proves that $P^n (\R)$ is a Hausdorff space.

### Möbius strip

The Möbius strip can be defined as the square $X = [0, 1] \times (-1,1) \in \R \times \R$ with the equivalence relation $(0, s) \sim (1, -s) \implies x \neq \pm y$.

## Metrizable spaces
<MathBox title='Projections are continuous' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. If there exists a metric $d$ on $X$ such that $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_d$, i.e. the topology induced by $d$, then $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called metrizable.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Equivalence of metrics' boxType='definition'>
Let $X$ be a set. Metrics $d$ and $e$ on $X$ are equivalent, denoted $d\equiv e$ if $\mathcal{T}_d = \mathcal{T}_e$. The relation $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation on the collection of metrics on $X$ satisfying (for metrics $d,e,f$ on $X$):
1. reflexivity: $d\equiv d$
2. symmetry: $d\equiv e \implies e\equiv d$
3. transitivity: $d\equiv e \land e\equiv f \implies d\equiv f$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Partial order of metrics' boxType='proposition'>
Let $X$ be a set with metrics $d$ and $e$. Then $\mathcal{T}_e$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}_d$, i.e. $\mathcal{T}_d \subseteq \mathcal{T}_e$, if and only if every open ball relative to $d$ contains an open ball relative to $e$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $\mathcal{T}_d \subseteq \mathcal{T}_e$, i.e. $\mathcal{T}_e$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}_d$. For each $x\in X$ and $a > 0$, the open ball $B_d(x, a)$ at $x$ is in $\mathcal{T}_d$ and hence also in $\mathcal{T}_e$. Thus, there exists $b > 0$ such that $B_e(x, b)\subseteq B_d(x, a)$. Conversely, suppose that every open ball relative to $d$ contains an open ball relative to $e$. Consider an arbitrary open set $U\in\mathcal{T}_d$. For each $x\in U$, there is $a > 0$ such that $B_d(x, a)\subseteq U$. Thus, there is $b > 0$ such that $B_e(x, b)\subseteq B_d(x, e)\subseteq U$. Hence $U\in\mathcal{T}_e$ showing that $\mathcal{T}_d\subseteq\mathcal{T}_e$

<MathBox title='Urysohn metrization theorem' boxType='theorem'>
A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is metrizable if it is a regular, second-countable, Hausdorff space.

# Topological manifolds

<MathBox title='Topological manifold' boxType='definition'>
A topological space $M$ is a topological manifold of dimension $n\in\N_+$ if it has the following properties:
1. $M$ is a *Hausdorff space*: for every pair of distinct points $p,q\in M$ there are disjoint subsets $U, V\subseteq M$ such that $p\in U$ and $q \in V$.
2. $M$ is *second-countable*: there exists a countable basis for the topology of $M$.
3. $M$ is *locally Euclidean of dimension* $n$: each point of $M$ has a neighbourhood that is homemorphic to an open subset of $\R^n$.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

More specifically, the third property means that for each $p\in M$ we can find
- an open subset $U\subseteq M$ containing $p$
- an open subset $\U' \subseteq\R^n$
- a homeomorphism $\varphi: U'\to\U'$
</details>
</MathBox>

An $n$-dimensional topological manifold is a Hausdorff topological space $(M, \mathcal{T})$ with a second-countable basis for the topology which is locally homeomorphic to $\R^n$ (Euclidean space).

## Coordinate charts

<MathBox title='Coordinate chart' boxType='definition'>
A (coordinate) chart on a topological $n$-manifold $M$ is a pair $(U, \varphi)$ where $U$ is an open subset of $M$, called a coordinate domain/neighbourhood, and $\varphi:U\to \tilde{U}$, called a (local) coordinate map, is a homemorphism to an open subset $\tilde{U} = \varphi(U)\subseteq\R^n$. The collection of charts $\mathcal{A} := \Set{ \left( U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha \right) }$ covering $M$, i.e. $M = \bigcup_\alpha U_\alpha$, is called an atlas. 
</MathBox>

Given a chart $(U, \varphi)$, the coordinate domain $U$ get some special names depending on the shape of the image $\varphi(U)$:
- if $\varphi(U)$ is an open ball, $U$ is called a *coordinate ball*
- if $\varphi(U)$ is an open cube, $U$ is called a *coordinate cube

Because a topological $n$-manifold $M$ is local homeomorphic to $\R^n$, each point $p \in M$ is contained in the domain of some chart $(U,\varphi)$.

## Submanifolds

Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional manifold, then $M_0 \subseteq M$ is called a $k$-dimensional submanifold of $M$ if for all $p\in M_0$ there is a chart $(U, h)$ of $M$ with

$$
  h\left[M_0 \cap U \right] = \left(\R^k \times \mathbf{0}_{n-k} \right) \cup U'
$$

where $(U, h)$ is called a submanifold chart for $M_0$.

## $n$-sphere

For $n\in\N_+$, a unit $n$-sphere is defined as (in terms of the Euclidean norm) the set

$$
  S^n := \Set{\mathbf{x} \in\R^{n+1} | \lVert x \rVert = 1}
$$

An $n$-sphere is a topological subspace of $\R^{n+1}$ and is thus Hausdorff and second-countable. To show that an $n$-sphere is locally homeomorphic to $\R^n$, note that it it can be covered by open sets given by 

$$
  U_i^\pm := \Set{(x^i)_{i=1}^{n+1} \in\R^{n+1} | \pm x^i > 0}
$$

where $U_i^+$ and $U_i^-$ denote the subsets of $\R^{n+1}$ where the $i$th coordinate is positive and negative, respectively. 

Let $f:B^n \to\R$ be the continuous function $f(\mathbf{u}) = \sqrt{1 - \lVert\mathbf{u}\rVert^2}$, where $B^n$ is the unit $n$-ball. For each $i=1,\dots,n+1$, it is easily seen that $U_i^+ \cap S^n$ is the grap of the function

$$
  x^i = f(x^1,\dots, x^{i-1},x^{i+1},\dots,x^{n+1})
$$

Similarly, $U_i^- \cap S^n$ is the graph of the function

$$
  x^i = -f(x^1,\dots, x^{i-1},x^{i+1},\dots,x^{n+1})
$$

Thus, each subset $U_i^\pm \cap S^n$ is locally homeomorphic to $\R^n$ and the maps $\varphi_i^\pm (x^1,\dots,x^{n+1}) = (x^1,\dots,x^{i-1},x^{i+1},\dots,x^n)$, removing the $i$th coordinate, are graph coordinates for $S^n$. Since each point of $S^n$ is in the domain of least one of these $2n + 2$ charts, $S^n$ is a topological $n$-manifold.

## Projective space

Recall that the projective space is defined as $P^n (\R) := S^n / \sim$ with the equivalence relation $\mathbf{x}\sim \mathbf{y} :\iff \mathbf{x}=\pm \mathbf{y}$. The canonical projection $\pi: S^n \rightarrow S^n / \sim$ is given by $\mathbf{x} \mapsto [\mathbf{x}]_\sim$. The projective space can be covered by open sets

$$
  V_i := \Set{ [\mathbf{x}]_\sim \in P^n (\R) | x^i \neq 0 }
$$

The pre-image of $V_i$ under $\pi$ is given by 

$$
  \pi^{-1}\left[ V_i \right] = U_i^+ \cup U_i^-
$$

where $U_i^\pm := \Set{\mathbf{x} \in \R^{n+1} | \pm x^i > 0}$ are open hemispheres. 

Define charts $\varphi_i : V_i \rightarrow \tilde{V}_i \subseteq \R^n$ can be formed by taking the slopes with respect to the $i$th component

$$
  \varphi_i\left( [\mathbf{x}]_\sim \right) = \left( \frac{x^1}{x^i}, \dots, \frac{x_{i-1}}{x^i},\frac{x^{i+1}}{x^i},\dots,\frac{x^{n+1}}{x^i} \right)
$$

This map is well-defined because its value is unchanged by multiplying $x$ by a nonzero constant. Because $\varphi_i \circ \pi$ is continuous, $\varphi_i$ is continuous by the characteristic property of quotient maps. It is in fact a hemomorphism with a continuous inverse

$$
  \varphi^{-1}\left(\tilde{x}^i \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\tilde{x}^i \right)^2}}\left( \tilde{x}^1,\dots, \tilde{x}^{i-1}, 1, \tilde{x}^{i+1}, \dots, \tilde{x}^{n} \right)
$$

## Topological properties of manifolds

<MathBox title='' boxType='lemma'>
Every topological manifold has a countable basis of precompact coordinate balls.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $M$ be a topological $n$-manifold. First, we consider the special case in which $M$ can be covered by a single chart. Support $\varphi: M\to \tilde{U} \subseteq\R^n$ is a global coordinate map, and let $\mathcal{B}$ be the collection of all open balls $B_r (\mathbf{x})\subseteq\R^n$ such that $r$ is rational, $x$ has rational coordinates, and $B_{r'}(\mathbf{x} \subseteq \tilde{U}$ for some $r' > r$. Each such ball is precompact in $\tilde{U}$, and it is easy to check that $\mathcal{B}$ is a countable basis for the topology of $\tilde{U}$. Because $\varphi$ is homeomorphism, it follows that the collection of sets of the form $\varphi^{-1}(B)$ for $B\in\mathcal{B}$ is a countable basis for the topology of $M$, consisting of precompact balls, with the restrictions of $\varphi$ as coordinate maps.

Next, let $M$ be an arbitrary $n$-manifold. By definition, each point $M$ is in the domain of a chart. Because every open cover of a second-countable space has a countable subcover, $M$ is covered by countably many charts $\Set{(U_i, \varphi_i)}_{i\in I \subseteq\N}$. By the preceding argument, each coordinate domain $U_i$ has a countable basis of coordinate balls that are precompact in $U_i$, and the union of all these countable basis is a countable basis for the topology of $M$. If $V\subseteq U_i$ is one of these balls, then the closure of $V$ in $U_i$ is compact, and because $M$ is Hausdorff, it is closed in $M$. It follows that the closure of $V$ in $M$ is the same as its closure in $U_i$, so $V$ is precompact in $M$ as well.

<MathBox title='Connectivity properties of manifolds' boxType='proposition'>
If $M$ is a topological manifold, then
1. $M$ is locally path-connected
2. $M$ is connected if and only if it is path-connected
3. the components of $M$ are the same as its path components
4. $M$ has countably many components, each of which is an open subset of $M$ and a connected topological manifold

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Since each coordinate ball is path-connected, **(1)** follows from the fact that $M$ has a basis of coordinate balls. Parts **(2)** and **(3)** follow directly from **(1)**. To prove **(4)**, note the each component is open in $M$ by proposition *X*, so the collection of components is an open cover of $M$. Because $M$ is second-countable, this cover must have a countable subcover. Since the components are all disjoint, the cover must have been countable to begin with, which is to say that $M$ has only countably many components. Because the components are open, they are connected topological manifolds in the subspace topology.

<MathBox title='Manifolds are locally compact' boxType='proposition'>
Every topological manifold is locally compact.

<MathBox title='Paracompactness' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a topological space. A collection $\mathcal{X}$ of subsets of $M$ is *locally finite* if each point of $M$ has a neighbourhood that intersects at most finitely many of the sets in $\mathcal{X}$. Given a cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $M$, another cover $\mathcal{V}$ is a called a refinement of $U$ if for each $V\in\mathcal{V}$ there exists some $U\in\mathcal{U}$ such that $V\subseteq U$. We say that $M$ is paracompact if every open cover of $M$ admits an open, locally finite refinement.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Manifolds are paracompact' boxType='theorem'>
Every topological manifold is paracompact. In fact, given a topological manifold $M$, an open cover $\mathcal{X}$ of $M$, and any basis $\mathcal{B}$ for the topology of $M$, there exists a countable, locally finite open refinement of $\mathcal{X}$, consisting of elements of $\mathcal{B}$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $(K_j)_{j=1}^\infty$ be an exhaustion of $M$ by compact sets. For each $j$, let $V_j = K_{j+1}/\mathrm{int}(K_j)$ and $W_j = \mathrm{int}(K_{j+1})/K_{j-1}$, where $K_j = \emptyset$ for $j < 1$. Then $V_j$ is a compact set contained in the open subset $W_j$. For each $x\in V_j$ there is some $X_x \in \mathcal{X}$ containing $x$, and because $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis, there exists $B_x \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B_x \subseteq X_x \cap W_j$. The collection of all such sets $B_x$ as $x$ ranges over $V_j$ is an open cover of $V_j$, and thus has a finite subcover. The union of all such finite subcovers as $j$ ranges over the positive integers is a countable open cover of $M$ that refines $\mathcal{X}$. Because the finite subcover of $V_j$ consists of sets contained in $W_j$, and $W_j \cap W_{j'} = \emptyset$ except when $j-2 \leq j' \leq j+2$, the resulting cover is locally finite.

## Manifolds with boundary

<MathBox title='Upper half space' boxType='definition'>
The upper half space $H^n \subseteq\R^n$ is defined as

$$
  H^n := \Set{(x^i)_{i=1}^n \in\R^n | x^n \geq 0}
$$

with interior $\mathrm{int}(H^n)$ and boundary $\partial H^n$ given by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{int}(H^n) =& \Set{(x^i)_{i=1}^n \in\R^n | x^n > 0} \\
  \partial H^n =& \Set{(x^i)_{i=1}^n \in\R^n | x^n = 0}
\end{align*}
$$

If $n=0$, then $H^0 = \R^0 = \Set{0}$ with $\mathrm{int}(H^n) = \R^0$ and $\partial H^0 = \emptyset$.
</MathBox>

A topological $n$-manifold with boundary is a second-countable Hausdorff space $M$ in which every point has a neighbourhood homoemorphic either to an open subset of $\R^n$ or to a (relatively) open subset of $H^n$.

An open subset $U\subseteq M$ together with a map $\varphi: U\to\R^n$ that is homeomorphic with an open subset of $\R^n$ or $H^n$ is called a chart for $M$. If $\varphi(U)$ is a open subset of $\R^n$, including an open subset of $H^n$ that does not intersect $\partial H^n$, then $(U,\varphi)$ is an interior chart. If $\varphi(U)$ is an open subset of $H^n$ such that $\varphi(U)\cap\partial H^n \neq\emptyset$, then $(U,\varphi)$ is called a *boundary chart*. A boundary chart whose image is a set of the form $B_r(\mathbf{x}) \cap H^n$ for some $\mathbf{x}\in\partial H^n$ and $r > 0$ is called a *coordinate half-ball*.

A point $p\in M$ is called an *interior point* of $M$, i.e. $p\in\mathrm{int}(M)$ if it is in the domain of some interior chart. It is a *boundary point* of $M$, i.e. $p\in\partial M$, if it is in the domain of a boundary chart that sends $p$ to $\partial H^n$.

<MathBox title='Topological invariance of the boundary' boxType='theorem'>
If $M$ is a topological manifold with boundary, then each point of $M$ is either a boundary point or an interior point, but not both. Thus, $\partial M$ and $\mathrm{int}(M)$ are disjoint sets whose union is $M$.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>

1. $\mathrm{int}(M)$ is an open subset of $M$ and a topological $n$-manifold without boundary
2. $\partial M$ is a closed subset of $M$ and a topological $(n-1)$-manifold without boundary
3. $M$ is a topological manifold if and only if $\partial M = \emptyset$

# Smooth manifolds

<MathBox title='Diffeomorphism' boxType='theorem'>
Let $U \subseteq \R^n$ and $U \subseteq \R^m$ be open subsets of Euclidean space. A function $f: U \rightarrow V$ is $k$-times continuously differentiable, i.e. $f \in C^k$, if all partial derivatives of $f$ up to the $k$-th order exist and are continuous. For $k=\infty$, $f\in C^\infty$ is called *smooth* or *infinitely differentiable*. If $f$ is bijective with a differentiable inverse map, it is called a *diffeomorphism*, which by definition is a homeomorphism.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Smooth manifold' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a topological $n$-manifold. If $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ are two charts such that $U\cap V \neq \emptyset$, the composite chart $\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}: \varphi(U\cap V) \to\psi(U\cap V=$ is called the *transition map* from $\varphi$ to $\psi$. It is a composition of homeomorphisms, and is thus itself a homeomorphism. Two charts $(U,\varphi)$ and $\psi(U\cap V)$ are *smoothly compatible* if either $U\cap V = \emptyset$ or the transition map $\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is a diffeomorphism. 

An atlas $\mathcal{A}$ on $M$ is called a *smooth atlas* if any two charts in $\mathcal{A}$ are smoothly compatible with each other. A smooth atlas $\mathcal{A}$ is *maximal* (complete) if it is not properly contained in any larger smooth atlas. 

A *smooth structure* on $M$ is a maximal smooth atlas. A smooth (differentiable) manifold $(M, \mathcal{A})$ is a topological manifold $M$ equipped with a maximal smooth atlas $\mathcal{A}$, called a smooth structure. 
</MathBox>

The notion of smooth structure can be specified in different ways by changing the compatibility requirements for charts:
- A $C^k$ structure requires each transition map to be $C^k$ diffeomorphic. A manifold endowed with such a structure is called a $C^k$ manifold.
- A *real-analytic structure* requires that each transition map is expressible as a convergent power series in a neighbourhood of each point. A manifold endowed with such a structure is called a *real-analytic manifold*.
- If $M$ has even dimension $n = 2m$, we can identify $\R^{2m}$ with $\mathrm{C}^m$ and require that the transition maps be complex-analytic, yielding a *complex-analytic manifold*.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a topological $n$-manifold.
1. Every smooth atlas $\mathcal{A}$ for $M$ is contained in a unique maximal smooth atlas, called the smooth structure determined by $\mathcal{A}$.
2. Two smooth atlases for $M$ determine the same smooth structure if and only if their union is a smooth atlas.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a smooth atlas for $M$ and let $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ denote the set of all charts that are smoothly compatible with every chart in $\mathcal{A}$. To show that $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ is a smooth atlas, we need to show that any two charts of $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ are smoothly compatible with each other, that is for ny $(U,\varphi), (V,\psi)\in\overline{\mathcal{A}}$, the transition map $\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}: \varphi(U\cap V)\to \psi(U\cap V)$ is smooth.

Let $\mathbf{x} = \varphi(p) \in \varphi(U \cap V)$ be arbitrary. Because that domains of the charts in $\mathcal{A}$ cover $M$, there is some chart $(W,\theta)\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $p\in W$. Since every chart in $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ is smoothly compatible with $(W,\theta)$, both of the maps $\theta\circ\varphi^{-1}$ and $\psi\circ\theta^{-1}$ are smooth where they are defined. Since $p\in U\cap V\cap W$, it follows that $\psi\circ\varphi^{-1} = (\psi\circ\theta^{-1})\circ(\theta\circ\varphi^{-1})$ is smooth on a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{x}$. Thus, $\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is smooth in a neighbourhood of each point in $\varphi(U\cap V)$. Therefore, $\mathcal{A}$ is a smooth atlas. To that it is maximal, note that any chart that is smoothly compatible with every chart in $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ must in particular be smoothly compatible with every chart in $\mathcal{A}$, so it is already on $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$. This proves the existence of a maximal smooth atlas containing $\mathcal{A}$. If $\mathcal{B}$ is any other maximal smooth atals containin $\mathcal{A}$, each of its charts is smoothly compatible with each chart in $\mathcal{A}$, so $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\overline{\mathcal{A}}$. By maximality of $\mathcal{B}$, it follows that $\mathcal{B} = \overline{\mathcal{A}}$.

<MathBox title='Regular coordinate ball' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ is a smooth manifold, any set $B\subseteq M$ is a *regular coordinate ball* if there is a smooth coordinate ball $B' \supseteq \overline{B}$ and a smooth coordinate map $\varphi: B' \to\R^n$ such that for some positive real numbers $r < r'$

$$
\begin{align*}
  \varphi(B) =& B_r (0) \\
  \varphi(\overline{B}) =& \overline{B}_r (0) \\
  \varphi(B') = B_{r'}(0)
\end{align*}
$$

Because $\overline{B}$ is homeomorphic to $\overline{B}_r (0)$ it is compact, and thus every regular coordinate ball is precompact in $M$.

<MathBox title='' boxType='lemma'>
Every smooth manifold has a countable basis of regular coordinate balls.

## Smooth structures on manifolds with boundary

Recall that a map from an arbitrary subset $A\subseteq\R^n \to\R^n$ is smooth if, in a neighbourhood of each point of $A$, it admits an extension to a smooth map defined on an open subset of $\R^n$. Thus, if $U$ is an open subset of $H^n$, a map $F:U\to\R^n$ is smooth if for each $\mathbf{x}\in U$, there exists an open substeq $\tilde{U}\subseteq\R^n$ containing $\mathbf{x}$ and a smooth map $\tilde{F}:\tilde{U}\to\R^k$ that agrees with $F$ on $\tilde{U}\cap H^n$.

If $F$ is such a map, the restriction of $F$ to $U\cap\mathrm{int}(H^n)$ is smooth in the usual sense. By continuity, all partial derivatives of $F$ at points of $U\cap\partial H^n$ are determined by their values in $\mathrm{int}(H^n)$, and there in particular are independent of the choice of extension. It is a fact that $F:U\to\R^k$ is smooth in this sense if and only if $F$ is continuous, $F|_{U\cap\mathrm{int}(H^n)}$ is smooth, and the partial derivatives of $F|_{U\cap\mathrm{int}(H^n)}$ of all orders have continuous extensions to all of $U$.

Let $M$ be a topological manifold with boundary. A smooth structure for $M$ is defined to be a maximal smooth atlas, a collection of charts whose domains cover $M$ and whose transition maps (and their inverses) are smooth in the sense just described. With such a structure, $M$ is called a smooth manifold with boundary.

A subset $B\subseteq M$ is a *regular coordinate half-ball* if there is a smooth coordinate half-ball $B' \supseteq \overline{B}$ and a smooth coordinate map $\varphi: B'\to H^n$ such that for some $r' > r > 0$ we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \varphi(B) =& B_r (\mathbf{0}) \cap H^n \\
  \varphi(\overline{B}) =& \overline{B}_r(\mathbf{0}) \cap H^n \\
  \varphi(B') = B_{r'} =& B_{r'} (\mathbf{0}) \cap H^n
\end{align*}
$$

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M_1,\dots,M_k$ are smooth manifolds and $N$ is a smooth manifold with boundary. Then $M_1 \times\cdots\times M_k \times N$ is a smooth manifold with boundary, and $\partial(M_1 \times\cdots\times M_k \times N) = M_1 \times\cdots\times M_k \times \partial N$.

<MathBox title='Smooth invariance of the boundary' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with boundary and $p\in M$. If there is some smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ such that $\varphi(U)\subseteq H^n$ and $\varphi(p)\in \partial H^n$, then same is true for every smooth chart whose domain contains $p$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose on the contrary that $p$ is in the domain of a smooth interior chart $(U,\psi)$ and also in the domain of a smooth boundary chart $(V,\varphi)$ such that $\varphi(p)\in\partial H^n$. Let $\tau = \varphi\circ\psi^{-1}$ denote the transition map, which is a homeomorphism from $\psi(U\cap V)$ to $\varphi(U \cap V)$. The smooth compatibility of the charts ensures that both $\tau$ and $\tau^{-1}$ are smooth, in the sense that locally they can be extended, if necessary, to smooth maps defined on open subsets of $\R^n$.

Write $\mathbf{x}_0 = \psi(p)$ and $\mathbf{y}_0 = \varphi(p) = \tau(\mathbf{x}_0)$. There is some neighbourhood $W$ of $\mathbf{y}_0$ in $\R^n$ and a smooth function $\eta: W\to\R^n$ that agrees with $\tau^{-1}$ on $W\cap\varphi(U\cap V)$. On the other hand, because we are assuming that $\psi$ is an interior chart, there is an open Euclidean ball $B$ that is centered at $x_0$ and contained in $\varphi(U\cap V)$, so $\tau$ itself is smooth on $B$ in the ordinary sense. After shrinking $B$ if necessary, we may assume that $B\subseteq \tau^{-1}(W)$. Then $\eta\circ\tau|_B = \tau^{-1} \circ\tau|_B = \mathrm{id}_B$, so it follows from the chain rule that $\mathrm{D}\eta(\tau(\mathbf{x}))\circ\mathrm{D}\tau(\mathbf{x})$ is the identity map for each $x\in B$. Since $\mathrm{D}\tau(\mathbf{x})$ is a square matrix, this implies that it is non-singular. It follows that $\tau$ as a map from $B\to\R^n$ is an open map, so $\tau(B)$ is an open subset of $\R^n$ that contains $\mathbf{y}_0 = \varphi(p)$ and is contained in $\varphi(V)$. This contradicts the assumption that $\varphi(V)\subseteq H^n$ and $\varphi(p)\in\partial H^n$.

## Smooth maps

Generally, the terms *function* and *map* are synonymous. However, it is convenient to make a distinction between them in studying smooth manifolds. In the following discussion the term *function* is reserved for a map whose codomain is a vector space of fields, usually $\R^n$ and $\mathbb{C}^n$ for $n\in\N_+$. Either of the words *map* or *mapping* can mean any type of relation, such as a map between arbitrary manifolds.

### Smooth functions on manifolds

Suppose that $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold. A function $f:M\to\R^k$ for $k\in\N_+$ is smooth if for every $p\in M$ there exists a smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ whose domain contains $p$ and such that the composite function $f\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is smooth on the subset $\tilde{U} = \varphi(U)\subseteq\R^n$. 

If $M$ is a smooth manifold with boundary, $\varphi(U)$ is an open subset of either $\R^n$ or $H^n$, and in the latter case we interpret smoothness of $f\circ\varphi^{-1}$ to mean that each point of $\varphi(U)$ has a neighbourhood on which $f\circ\varphi^{-1}$ extends to a smooth function in the ordinary sense.

Given a function $f:M\to\R^k$ and a chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$, the function $\tilde{f}:\varphi(U)\to\R^k$ defined by $\tilde{f}(\mathbf{x}) = f\circ\varphi^{-1}(\mathbf{x})$ is called the coordinate representation of $f$. By definition, $f$ is smooth if and only if its coordinate representation is smooth in some smooth chart around each point. Smooth functions have smooth coordinate representations in every smooth chart.

### Smooth maps between manifolds

Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds. A map $F:M\to N$ is smooth if for every $p\in M$, there exists smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ containing $p$ and $(V,\psi)$ containing $F(p)$ such that $F(U) \subseteq V$ and the composite map $\psi\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is smooth from $\varphi(U)$ to $\psi(V)$. If $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with boundary, smoothness of $F$ is defined in exactly the same way.

$$
\begin{CD}
  U\subseteq M @>F>> F(U)\subseteq V\subseteq N \\
  @V{\varphi}VV @VV{\psi}V \\
  \varphi(U)\subseteq\R^m @>>\psi\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1}> \psi(V)\subseteq\R^n
\end{CD}
$$

If $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map, and $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ are any smooth charts for $M$ and $N$, respectively, we call $\tilde{F} = \psi\circ F \circ\varphi^{-1}$ the coordinate representation of $F$ with respect to the given coordinates. It maps the set $\varphi(U\cap F^{-1} (V))$ to $\psi(V)$

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Every smooth map is continuous.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and that $F:M\to N$ is smooth. Given $p\in M$, smoothness of $F$ means that there are smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ containing $p$, and $(V,\psi)$ containing $F(p)$, such that $F(U) \subseteq V$ and $\psi\circ F\circ \varphi^{-1}: \varphi(U)\to\psi(V)$ is smooth, hence continuous. Since $\varphi: U\to\varphi(U)$ and $\psi:V\to\psi(V)$ are homemorphisms, it follows that

$$
  F|_U = \psi^{-1}\circ (\psi\circ F\circ \varphi^{-1})\circ\varphi: U\to V
$$

which is a composition of continuous maps. Since $F$ is continuous in a neighbourhood of each point, it is continuous on $M$.

**(4):** Let $p\in M$. By definition of smoothness of $G$, there exists smooth charts $(V,\theta)$ containing $F(p)$ and $(W,\psi)$ contining $G(F(p))$ such that $G(V)\subseteq W$ and $\psi\circ G\circ\theta^{-1}: \theta(V) \to \psi(W)$ is smooth. Since $F$ is continuous, $F^{-1}(V)$ is a neigbourhood of $p\in M$, so there is a smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ such that $p\in U\subseteq F^{-1}(V)$. The coordinate representation $\theta\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is smooth from $\varphi(U)$ to $\theta(V)$. It follows that $G\circ F(U)\subseteq G(V)\subseteq W$ is smooth because it is a composition of smooth maps between subsets of Euclidean spaces.

Suppose that $M$ is a nonempty smooth $m$-manifold, $N$ is a nonempty smooth $n$-manifold, and $F:M\to N$ is a diffeomorphism. Choose any point $p\in M$, and let $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ be smooth coordinate charts containing $p$ and $F(p)$ respectively. Then the restriction of $\tilde{F} = \psi\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1}:\varphi(U)\to\psi(V)$ is a diffeomorphism from an open subset of $\R^m$ to an open subset of $\R^n$. 

Because $\tilde{F}^{-1} \circ\tilde{F} = \mathrm{id}_{\varphi(U)}$, the chain rule implies that for each $\mathbf{x}\in \varphi(U)$

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{id}_{\R^n} =& \mathrm{D}(\mathrm{id}_{\varphi(U)})(\mathbf{x}) = \mathrm{D}(\tilde{F}^{-1}\circ\tilde{F})(\mathbf{x}) \\
  =& \mathrm{D}(\tilde{F}^{-1})(\tilde{F}(\mathbf{x}))\circ\mathrm{D}\tilde{F}(\mathbf{x})

Similarly, $\tilde{F}\circ\tilde{F}^{-1} = \mathrm{id}_{\psi(V)}$ implies that $\mathrm{id}_{\R^m} = \mathrm{D}F(\mathbf{x})\circ\mathrm{D}(\tilde{F}^{-1})(\tilde{F}(\mathbf{x}))$. This implies that $\mathrm{D}(\tilde{F}(\mathbf{x}))$ is invertible with inverse $\mathrm{D}(\tilde{F}^{-1})(\tilde{F}(\mathbf{x}))$, and hence $m = n$.

Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and $\mathcal{X} = (X_\alpha)_{\alpha\in A}$ is any indexed open cover of $M$. Then there exists a smooth partition of unity subordinate to $\mathcal{X}$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

For simplicity, suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold without boundary. Each set $X_\alpha$ is a smooth manifold in its own right, and thus has a basis $\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ of regular coordinate balls and it is easy to check that $\mathcal{B} = \bigcup_\alpha \mathcal{B}_\alpha$ is a basis for the topology of $M$. It follows that $\mathcal{X}$ has a countable, locally finite refinement $\Set{B_i}$ consisting of elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The cover $\Set{\overline{B}_i}$ is also locally finite.

For each $i$, the fact that $B_i$ is a regular coordinate ball in some $X_\alpha$ guarantees that there is a coordinate ball $B'_i \subseteq X_\alpha$ such that $B'_i \supseteq \overline{B}_i$, and a smooth coordinate map $\varphi_i: B'_i \to\R^n$ such that $\varphi_i(\overline{B}_i) = \overline{B}_{r_i}(\mathbf{0})$ and $\varphi_i(B'_i) = B_{r'_i}(\mathbf{0})$ for some $r_i < r'_i$. For each $i$, defined a function $f_i:M\to\R$ by

$$
  f_i = \begin{cases}
    H_i \circ\varphi_i \quad& \text{on } B'_i \\
    0 \quad& \text{on } M\setminus\overline{B}_i
  \end{cases}
$$

where $H_i:\R^n \to\R$ is a smooth function that is positive in $B_{r_i}(\mathbf{0})$ and zero elsewhere. On the set $B'_i\setminus\overline{B}_i$ where the two definitions overlap, both definitions yield the zero function, $f_i$ is well-defined and smooth with $\mathrm{supp}(f_i) = \overline{B}_i$.

Define $f:M\to\R$ by $f(x) = \sum_i f_i(x)$. Because of the local finiteness of the cover $\Set{\overline{B}_i}$, this sum has only finitely many nonzero terms in a neighbourhood of each point and thus defines a smooth function. Because each $f_i$ is nonnegative everywhere and positive on $B_i$, and every point of $M$ is in some $B_i$, it follows that $f(x) > 0$ everywhere on $M$. Thus, the functions $g_i:M\to\R$ defined by $g_i (x) \frac{f_i (x)}{f(x)}$ are also smooth. It is immediate from the definition that $0\leq g_i \leq 1$ and $\sum_i g_i \equiv 1$.

Finally, we need to reindex our functions so that they are indexed by the same set $A$ as our open cover. Because the cover $\Set{B'_i}$ is a refinement of $\mathcal{X}$, for each $i$ we can choose some index $a(i)\in A$ such taht $B'_i \subseteq X_{a(i)}$. For each $\alpha\in A$, define $\psi_\alpha: M\to\R$ by

$$
  \psi_\alpha = \sum_{i:a(i) = \alpha} g_i
$$

If there are no indices $i$ for which $a(i) = \alpha$, then this sum should be interpreted as the zero function. It follos that

$$
  \mathrm{supp}(\psi_\alpha) = \overline_{\bigcup_{i:a(i) = \alpha} B_i} = \bigcup_{i:a(i) = \alpha} \overline{B}_i \subseteq X_\alpha
$$

Each $\psi_\alpha$ is a smooth function that satisfies $0\leq\psi_\alpha \leq 1$. Moreover, the collection of supports $\Set{\mathrm{supp}(\psi_\alpha)}_{\alpha\in A}$ is still locally finite, and $\sum_\alpha \psi_\alpha \equiv \sum_i g_i \equiv 1$, which is the desired partition of unity.

#### Applications of partitions of unity

<MathBox title='Bump function' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ is a topological space, $A\subseteq M$ is a closed subset, and $U\subseteq M$ is an open subset containing $A$, a continuous function $\psi:M\to\R$ is called a *bump function* for $A$ supported in $U$ if $0\leq\psi\leq 1$ on $M$ and $\psi\equiv 1$ on $A$ and $\mathrm{supp}(\psi) \subseteq U$.

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. For any closed subset $A\subseteq M$ and any open subset $U$ containing $A$, there exists a smooth bump function for $A$ supported in $U$.

Let $U_0 = U$ an $U_1 = M\setminus A$ and let $\Set{\psi_0, \psi_1}$ be a smooth partition of unity subordinate to the open cover $\Set{U_0, U_1}$. Because $\psi_1 \equiv 0$ on $A$ with $\psi_0 = \sum_i \psi_i = 0$, the functino $\psi_0$ has the required properties.

<MathBox title='Extension lemma for smooth function' boxType='lemma'>
Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, $A\subseteq M$ is a closed subset, and $f:A\to\R^k$ is a smooth function. For any open subset $U$ containing $A$, there exists a smooth function $\tilde{f}:M\to\R^k$ such that $\tilde{f}|_A = f$ and $\mathrm{supp}(\tilde{f})\subseteq U$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

For each $p\in A$, choose a neighbourhood $W_p$ of $p$ and a smooth function $\tilde{f}_p :W_p \to R^k$ that agrees with $f$ on $W_p \cap A$. Replacing $W_p$ by $W_p \cap U$, we may assume $W_p \subseteq U$. The collection of sets $\Set{W_p | p\in A}\cup M\setminus A$ is an open cover of $M$. Let $\Set{\psi_p | p\in A} \cup \Set{\psi_0}$ be a smooth partition of unity subordinate to this cover, with $\mathrm{supp}(\psi_p)\subseteq W_p$ and $\mathrm{supp}(\psi_0) \subseteq M\setminus A$.

For each $p\in A$, the product $\psi_p \tilde{f}_p$ is smooth on $W_p$, and has a smooth extension to all of $M$ if we interpret it to be zero on $M\setminus\mathrm{supp}(\psi_p)$. Thus, we can defined $\tilde{f}: M\to\R^k$ by

$$
  \tilde{f}(x) = \sum_{p\in A} \psi_p (x)\tilde{f}_p (x)
$$

Because the collection of supports $\Set{\psi_p}$ is locally finite, this sum has only a finite number of nonzero terms in a neighbourhood of any point of $M$, and therefore defines a smooth function. If $x\in A$, then $\psi_0 (x) = 0$ and $\tilde{f}_p (x) = f(x)$ for each $p$ such that $\psi_p (x) \neq 0$, so

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{f}(x) =& \sum_{p\in A} \psi_p(x)f(x) \\
  =& \left( \psi_0(x) + \sum_{p\in A} \psi_p (x) \right)f(x) \\
  =& f(x)
\end{align*}
$$

so $\tilde{f}$ is indeed an extension of $f$. It follows that 

$$
  \mathrm{supp}(\tilde{f}) = \overline{\bigcup_{p\in A}\mathrm{supp}(\psi_p)} = \bigcup_{p\in A} \mathrm{supp}(\psi_p) \subseteq U

<MathBox title='Exhaustion function' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ is a topological space, and *exhaustion function* for $M$ is a continuous function $f:M\to\R$ with the property that the set $f^{-1}((-\infty,c])$, called the sublevel set of $f$, is compact for each $c\in\R$. As $n$ ranges over the positive integers, the sublevel sets $f^{-1}((-\infty, n])$ form an exhaustion of $M$ by compact sets.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Existence of smooth exhaustion functions' boxType='proposition'>
Every smooth manifold with or without boundary admits a smooth positive exhaustion function.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\Set{V_j}_{j=1}^\infty$ be any countable open cover of $M$ by precompact open subsets, and let $\Set{\psi_j}$ be a smooth partition of unity subordinate to this cover. Define $f\in C^\infty (M)$ by

$$
  f(p) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty j\psi_j(p)
$$

Then $f$ is smooth because only finitely many terms are nonzero in a neighbourhood of any point, and positive because $f(p) \geq\sum_j \psi_j (p) = 1$.

To see that $f$ is an exhaustion function, let $c\in\R$ be arbitrary, and choose a positive integer $N > c$. If $p\notin \bigcup_{j=1}^N \overline{V}_j$, then $\psi_j(p) = 0$ for $1\leq j\leq N$, so

$$
\begin{align*}
  f(p) =& \sum_{j=N+1}^\infty j\psi_j (p) \\
  \geq& \sum_{j=N+1}^\infty N\psi_j (p) \\
  =& N\sum_{j=1}^\infty \psi_j (p) = N > c
\end{align*}
$$

Equivalently, if $f(p) \leq c$, then $p\in \bigcup_{j=1}^N \overline{V}_j$. Thus $f^{-1}((-\infty, c])$ is a closed subset of the compact set $\bigcup_{j=1}^N \overline{V}_j$ and is therefore compact.

<MathBox title='Level sets of smooth functions' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. If $K$ is any closed subset of $M$, there is a smooth nonnegative function $f:M\to\R$ such that $f^{-1}(0) = K$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**$M = \R^n$**<br/>
First, consider the special case in which $M = \R^n$ and $K\subseteq\R^n$ is a closed subset. For each $x \in M\setminus K$, there is a positive number $r \leq 1$ such that $B_r (x) \subseteq M\setminus K$. By second-countability, $M\subseteq K$ is the union of countably many such balls $\Set{B_{r_i}(x_i)}_{i=1}^\infty$.

Let $h:\R^n \to\R$ be a smooth bump function that is equal to $1$ on $\overline{B}_{1/2} (0)$ and supported in $B_1 (0)$. For each positive integer $i$, let $C_i \geq 1$ be a constant that bounds the absolute values of $h$ and all of its partial derivatives up through order $i$. Define $f:\R^n \to\R$ by

$$
  f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{(r_i)^i}{2^i C_i} h\left( \frac{x-x_i}{r_i} \right)
$$

The terms of the series are bounded in absolute value by those of the convergent series $\sum_i \frac{1}{2^i}$, so the entire series converges uniformly to a continuous function by the Weierstrass $M$-test. Because the $i$th term is positive extactly when $x\in B_{r_i}(x_i)$, it follows that $f$ is zero in $K$ and positive elsewhere.

It remains to show that $f$ is smooth. Suppose that $k\geq 1$ and assume by induction that all partial derivatives of $f$ of order less than $k$ exist and are continuous. By the chain rule and induction, every $k$th partial derivative of the $i$th term in the series can be written in the form

$$
  \frac{(r_i)^{i-k}}{2^i C_i} \mathrm{D}_k\left[h\left( \frac{x - x_i}{r_i} \right)\right]
$$

where $\mathrm{D}_k (h)$ is some $k$th partial derivative of $h$. By our choices of $r_i$ and $C_i$, as as $i\geq k$, each of these terms is bounded in absolute value by $\frac{1}{2^i}$, so the differentiated series also converges uniformly to a continuous function. It the follows from properties of uniform convergence that the $k$th partial derivatives of $f$ exist and are continuous. This completes the induction, and show that $f$ is smooth.

**$M$ arbitrary smooth manifold**<br/>
Let $M$ be an arbitrary smooth manifold, and $K\subseteq M$ any closed subset. Let $\Set{B_\alpha}$ be an open cover of $M$ by smooth coordinate balls, and let $\Set{\psi_\alpha}$ be a subordinate partition of unity. Since each $B_\alpha$ is diffeomorphic to $\R^n$, the preceeding argument show that for each $\alpha$ there is a smooth nonnegative function $f_\alpha: B_\alpha \to\R$ such that $f_\alpha^{-1}(0) = B_\alpha \cap K$. The functino $f = \sum_\alpha \psi_\alpha f_\alpha$ does the trick.

# Tangent space

## Geometric tangent vectors

<MathBox title='Geometric tangent vector' boxType='definition'>
Given a point $\mathbf{a}\in\R^n$, the *geometric tangent space* to $\R^n$ at $\mathbf{a}$, denoted $\R_\mathbf{a}^n$, is the set 

$$
  \Set{\mathbf{a}} \times \R^n = \Set{(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a} | \mathbf{v}\in \R^n}
$$

A *geometric tangent vector* $\mathbf{v}$ in $\R^n$ is an element of $\R_\mathbf{a}^n$ with initial point at $\mathbf{a}\in\R^n$. The set $\R_\mathbf{a}^n$ is a vector space.
</MathBox>

As a vector space, $\R_\mathbf{a}^n$ is essentially the same as $\R^n$ itself; the only reason for the additional index $\mathbf{a}$ is so that the geometric tangent spaces $\R_\mathbf{a}^n$ and $\R_\mathbf{b}^n$ at distinct points $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}\in \R^n$ will be disjoint sets.

The directional derivate of a geometric tangent vector $\mathbf{v}$ at $\mathbf{a}$ is a map $\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}: C^\infty (\R^n) \to\R$ defined by

$$
  \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(f) = \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v} f(\mathbf{a}) = \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t=0} f(\mathbf{a} + t\mathbf{v})
$$

This operation is linear over $\R$ and satisfies the product rule

$$
  \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a} (fg) = f(\mathbf{a})\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(g) + g(a)\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(f)
$$

If $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a} = v^i \mathbf{e}_i|_\mathbf{a}$ in terms of the standard basis, then by the rule, $\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(f)$ can written as

$$
  \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(f) = v^i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{a})
$$

<MathBox title='Derivation' boxType='definition'>
If $\mathbf{a}$ is a point of $\R^n$, a function $w: C^\infty (\R^n)\to\R$ is called a *derivation* at $\mathbf{a}$ if it is linear over $\R$ and satisfies the following product rule

$$
  w(fg) = f(\mathbf{a})wg + g(\mathbf{a})wf
$$
</MathBox>

Let $T_\mathbf{a}\R^n$ denote the set of all derivations of $C^\infty(\R^n)$ at $\mathbf{a}$. Clearly, $T_\mathbf{a} \R^n$ is a vector space under the operations

$$
\begin{align*}
  (w_1 + w_2)f =& w_1 f + w_2 f \\
  (cw)f =& c(wf)
\end{align*}
$$

<MathBox title='Properties of derivations' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $\mathbf{a}\in\R^n$, $w\in T_\mathbf{a} \R^n$ and $f,g\in C^\infty(\R^n)$.
1. If $f$ is a constant function, then $wf = 0$.
2. If $f(\mathbf{a}) = g(\mathbf{a}) = 0$, then $w(fg) = 0$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** It suffices to consider the constant function $f_1 (\mathbf{x}) \equiv 1$, for then $f(\mathbf{x}) \equiv c$ implies $wf = w(cf_1) = cw f_1 = 0$ by linearity. For $f_1$, the product rule gives

$$
\begin{align*}
  wf_1 =& w(f_1 f_1) \\
  =& f_1 (\mathbf{a})wf_1 + f_1 (\mathbf{a})w f_1 = 2wf_1
\end{align*}
$$

which implies that $wf_1 = 0$.

**(2):** Applyting the product rule gives

$$
  w(fg) = f(\mathbf{a})wg + g(\mathbf{a})wf = 0 + 0 = 0

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $\mathbf{a}\in\R^n$.
1. For each geometric tangent vector $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a} \in\R_\mathbf{a}^n$, the directional derivative $\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}: C^\infty (\R^n) \to\R$ is a derivation at $\mathbf{a}$.
2. The map $\mathbf{v}_a \mapsto \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}$ is an isomorphism from $\R_\mathbf{a}^n$ onto $T_\mathbf{a}\R^n$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** This follows from the product rule of the directional derivative.

**(2):** It is easily seen that $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a} \mapsto \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}$ is linear. To see that it is injective, suppose that $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a}\in\R_\mathbf{a}^n$ has the property that $\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}$ is the zero derivation. Writing $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a} = v^i \mathbf{e}_i|_\mathbf{a}$ in terms of the standard basis, and taking $f$ to be the $j$th coordinate function $x^j: \R^n\to\R$ thought of as a smooth function on $\R^n$, we obtain

$$
  0 = \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(x^j) = v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}(x^j)\right|_{\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{a}} = v^i \delta_i^j = v^j
$$

Since this is true for each $j$, it follows that $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a}$ is the zero vector.

To prove surjectivity, let $w\in T_\mathbf{a} \R^n$ be arbitrary and define $\mathbf{v} = v^i \mathbf{e}_i$ where $v^i = w(x^i)$. We will show that $w = \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}$. Let $f:\R^n \to\R$ be any smooth function. By Taylor's theorem, we can write

$$
\begin{align*}
  f(\mathbf{x}) =& f(\mathbf{a}) + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf{a})(x^i - a^i) \\
  &+ \sum_{i,j=1}^n (x^i - a^i)(x^j - a^j) \int_0^1 (1-t)\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}(\mathbf{a} + t(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a}))\;\mathrm{d}t
\end{align*}
$$

Note that each term in the last sum above is a product of two smooth functions of $\mathbf{x}$ that vanish at $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{a}$: one is (x^i - a^i), and the other is $(x^j - a^j)$ times the integral. The derivation $w$ annihilates this sum by its properties, giving

$$
\begin{align*}
  wf =& w(f(\mathbf{a})) + \sum_{i=1}^n w\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{a})(x^i - a^i)\right) \\
  =& 0 + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(x)(w(x^i) - w(a^i)) \\
  =& \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} (\mathbf{a})v^i = \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}(f)
\end{align*}

The set of all derivations of $C^\infty (M)$ at $\mathbf{p}$, denoted $T_\mathbf{p} M$, is a vector space called the *tangent space* to $M$ at $\mathbf{p}$. An element $\mathbf{v}$ of $T_\mathbf{p} M$ is called a *tangent vector* at $\mathbf{p}$.

## Differential of a smooth map

If $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary and $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map, the differential of $F$ at $\mathbf{p}\in M$ is the map

defined as follows. Given $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p} M$, we let $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v})$ be the derivation at $F(\mathbf{p})$ that acts on $f\in C^\infty$ by the rule

$$
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{v}(f\circ F)
$$

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

Note that if $f\in C^\infty (N)$, then $f\circ F \in C^\infty (M)$, so $\mathbf{v}(f\circ F)$ makes sense. The operator $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v}): C^\infty (N)\to\R$ is linear because $\mathbf{v}$ is, and is a derivation at $F(\mathbf{p})$ because for any $f,g\in C^\infty (N)$ we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{v})(fg) =& \mathbf{v}((fg)\circ F) = \mathbf{v}((f\circ F)(g\circ F)) \\

Because $\psi\equiv 1$ where $h$ is nonzero, the product $\psi h$ is identically equal to $h$. Since $h(\mathbf{p}) = \psi(\mathbf{p}) = 0$, it follows that $\mathbf{v}h = \mathbf{v}(\psi h) = 0$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

To show injectivity, suppose that $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p} U$ and $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v}) = 0\in T_\mathbf{p} M$. Let $B$ a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$ such that $\overline{B} \subseteq U$. If $f\in C^\infty (U)$ is arbitrary, the extension lemma for smooth function guarantees that there exists $\tilde{f}\in C^\infty(M)$ such that $\tilde{f}\equiv f$ on $\overline{B}$. Then since $f$ and $\tilde{f}|_U$ are smooth function on $U$ that agree in a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$, it follows from the previous proposition that

$$
  \mathbf{v}f = \mathbf{v}(\tilde{f}|_U) = \mathbf{v}(\tilde{f}\circ\iota) = \mathrm{d}\iota(\mathbf{v})_\mathbf{p} \tilde{f} = 0
$$

Since this holds for every $f\in C^\infty (U)$, it follows that $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$, so $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}$ is injective.

To show surjectivity, suppose that $w\in T_\mathbf{p} M$ is arbitrary. Define an operator $\mathbf{v}: C^\infty(U) \to\R$ by setting $\mathbf{v}f = \mathbf{w}\tilde{f}$, where $\tilde{f}$ is any smooth function on all of $M$ that agrees with $f$ on $\overline{B}$. By the previous proposition, $\mathbf{v}f$ is independent of the choice of $\tilde{f}$, so $\mathbf{v}$ is well-defined, and it is easy to check that it is a derivation of $C^\inft (U)$ at $\mathbf{p}$. For any $g\in C^\infty (M)$

$$
  \mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{v})g = \mathbf{v}(g\circ\iota) = \mathbf{w}(\tilde{g\circ\iota}) = \mathbf{w}g
$$

where the last two equalities follow from the fact that $g\circ\iota$, $\tilde{g\circ\iota}$ and $g$ all agree on $B$. Thus, $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{p}$ is also surjective.

Given $\mathbf{p}\in M$, let $(U,\varphi)$ be a smooth coordinate chart containing $\mathbf{p}$. Because $\varphi$ is a diffeomorphism from $U$ onto an open subset $\tilde{U}\subseteq\R^n$, follows from the properties of differentials that $\mathrm{d}\varphi_p$ is an isomorphism from $T_\mathbf{p} U \to T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\tilde{U}$. Since the previous proposition guarantees that $T_\mathbf{p} M \cong T_\mathbf{p} U$ and $T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\tilde{U} \cong T_{\varphi(p)} \R^n$ it follows that $\dim(T_\mathbf{p} M) = \dim(T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\R^n = n$.

To show that $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{a}$ is injective, assume that $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{a} (\mathbf{0}) = 0$. Suppose that $f:H^n \to\R^n$ is smooth, and let $\tilde{f}$ be any extension of $f$ to a smooth function defined on all of $\R^n$. Then $\tilde{f}\circ\iota = f$ and

  \mathbf{v}f = \mathbf{v}(\tilde{f}\circ\iota) = \mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{a} (\mathbf{v})\tilde{f} = 0

Define $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{a} H^n$ by $\mathbf{v}f = \mathbf{w}\tilde{f}$, where $\tilde{f}$ is any smooth extension of $f$. Writing $\mathbf{w} = w^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{a}$ in terms of the standard basis for $T_\mathbf{a} \R^n$, means that

$$
  \mathbf{v}f = w^i \frac{\partial\tilde{f}}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{a})
$$

This is independent of the choice of $\tilde{f}$, because by continuity the derivatives of $\tilde{f}$ at $\mathbf{a}$ are determined by those of $f$ in $H^n$. It is easy to check that $\mathbf{v}$ is a derivation at $\mathbf{a}$ and that $\mathbf{w} = \mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{a} (\mathbf{v})$, so $\mathrm{d}\iota_\mathbf{a}$ is surjective.

Suppose that $M$ is a an $n$-dimensional smooth manifold with boundary, then for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, the tangent space $T_\mathbf{p} M$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\mathbf{p}\in M$ be arbitrary. If $\mathbf{p}\in\mathrm{int}(M)$ it follows that $T_\mathbf{p}(\mathrm{int}(M)) \cong T_\mathbf{p} M$ because $\mathrm{int}(M)$ is an open submanifold. Since $\mathrm{int}(M)$ is a smooth $n$-manifold without boundary, its tangent spaces all have dimension $n$.

If $\mathbf{p}\in\partial M$, let $(U,\varphi)$ be a smooth boundary chart containing $\mathbf{p}$, and let $\tilde{U} = \varphi(U)\subseteq H^n$. Then we have the isomorphisms

$$
  T_\mathbf{p} M \cong T_\mathbf{p} U \cont T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\tilde{U} \cong T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} H^n \cong T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\R^n

<MathBox title='The tangent space to a vector space' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space with its standard smooth manifold structure. For each point $\mathbf{a}\in V$ and vector $\mathbf{v}\in V$, define the directional derivative $\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}:C^\infty (V) \to\R$ by

$$
  \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a} = \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t=0} f(\mathbf{a} + t\mathbf{v})
$$

The map $v \mapsto \mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}$ is a canonical isomorphism from $V$ to $T_a V$ such that for any linear map $L: V\to W$, the following diagram commutes:

$$
\begin{CD}

Suppose that $L:V\to W$ is a linear map. Because its components with respect to any choices of bases for $V$ and $W$ are linear functions of the coordinates, $L$ is smooth. Unwinding the definitions and using the linearity of $L$, we compute

## Coordinate vectors

Suppose that $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold without boundary, and let $(U,\varphi)$ be a smooth coordinate chart on $M$. Since $\varphi: U\to\tilde{U}\subseteq\R^n$ it follows that $\mathrm{d}\varphi_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p} U \to T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \R^n$ is an isomorphism. Furthermore, since $U$ is an open submanifold it follows that $T_\mathbf{p} U \cong T_\mathbf{p} M$ for every $\mathbf{p}\in M$. This implies that $\mathrm{d}\varphi_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p} M \to T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \R^n$ is an isomorphism.

The partial derivatives $\Set{\boldsymbol{\partial}_i\rvert_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}}_{i=1}^{n}$ forms a basis for $T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\R^n$. Thus, the preimages of these vectors under the isomorphism $\mathrm{d}\varphi_\mathbf{p}$ form a basis for $T_\mathbf{p}M$. These vector are denoted $\boldsymbol{\partial_i}|_\mathbf{p} = \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p}$, characterized by either of the following expressions:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} =& (\mathrm{d}\phi_\mathbf{p})^{-1} \left( \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \right) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(\varphi^{-1})_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \left( \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \right|_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

Unwinding these definitions, we see that $\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p}$ acts on a function $f\in C^\infty (U)$ by

$$
  \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} = \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}(f \circ\varphi^{-1}) = \frac{\partial \tilde{f}}{\partial x^i}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})
$$

where $\tilde{f} = f\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is the coordinate representation of $f$, $\tilde{\mathbf{p}} = (p^i)_{i=1}^n = \varphi(\mathbf{p})$ is the coordinate representation of $\mathbf{p}$. In other vords, $\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p}$ is just the derivation that takes the partial derivative of $f$ at $\mathbf{p}$. The vectors $\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p}$ are called the *coordinate vectors* at $\mathbf{p}$ associated with a given coordinate system. In the special case of standard coordinates on $\R^n$, the vectors $\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p}$ are literally the partial derivative operators.

If $M$ is a smooth manifold with boundary and $\mathbf{p}$ is an interior point, the discussion above applies verbatim. For $\mathbf{p}\in\partial M$, the only change that needs to be made is to substitute $H^n$ for $\R^n$, with the understanding that the notation $\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}$ can be used interchangeably to denote either an element of $T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \R^n$ or an element of $T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} H^n$, where we consider the isomorphism $\mathrm{d}\iota_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}: T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}H^n \to T_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\R^n$ as an identification. The $n$th coordinte vector $\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p}$ should be interpreted as a one-sided derivative in this case. 

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary, and let $\mathbf{p}\in M$. Then $T_\mathbf{p}M$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space, and for any smooth chart $(U, (x^i))$ containing $\mathbf{p}$, the cordinate vectors $\Set{\boldsymbol{\partial}_i\rvert_\mathbf{p}}_{i=1}^n$ form a basis for $T_\mathbf{p} M$.
</MathBox>

A tangent vector $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p} M$ can be written uniquely as a linear combination

$$
  \mathbf{v} = v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} = v^i \boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p}
$$

The ordered basis $(\boldsymbol{\partial}_i|_\mathbf{p})_{i=1}^n$ is a called a *coordinate basis* for $T_\mathbf{p} M$ and the scalars $(v^i)_{i=1}^n$ are called the *components* of $\mathbf{v}$ with respect to the coordinate basis. If $\mathbf{v}$ is known, its components can be easily computed from its action on the coordinate functions. For each $j$, the components of $\mathbf{v}$ are given by $v^j = \mathbf{v}(x^j)$, where $x^j:U\to\R$ is a smooth real-valued function, because

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{v}(x^j) =& \left( v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} \right)(x^j) \\
  =& v^i \frac{\partial x^j}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p}) \\
  =& v^i \delta_i^j = v^j
\end{align*}
$$

### Coordinate representation of differentials

In order to find a coordinate representation of differential, consider first the special case of a smooth map $F:U\to V$, where $U\subseteq\R^n$ and $V\subseteq\R^m$ are open subsets of Euclidean spaces. For any $\mathbf{p}\in U$, we determine the matrix of $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p} \R^n \to T_{F(\mathbf{p})} \R^m$ in terms of the standard coordinate bases. Using $(x^i)_{i=1}^n$ to denote the coordinates in the domain and $(y^j)_{j=1}^m$ to denote those in the codomain, we apply the chain rule to compute the action of $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{d}$ on a typical basis vector:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} \right) f =& \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} (f \circ F) \\
  =& \frac{\partial f}{\partial y^j} (F(\mathbf{p})) \frac{\partial F^j}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p}) \\
  =& \left( \frac{\partial F^j}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p}) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial y^j}\right|_{F(\mathbf{p})} \right)f
\end{align*}
$$

Thus

$$
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} \right) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y^j} (F(\mathbf{p})) \frac{\partial F^j}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{p})
$$

In other words, the matrix of $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ in terms of the coordinate basis is

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial F^1}{\partial x^1}(\mathbf{p}) & \cdots & \frac{\partial F^1}{\partial x^n}(\mathbf{p}) \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  \frac{\partial F^m}{\partial x^1}(\mathbf{p}) & \cdots & \frac{\partial F^m}{\partial x^n}(\mathbf{p})
\end{bmatrix}
$$

which is called the *Jacobian (matrix)* of $F$ at $\mathbf{p}$. The Jacobian is the matrix representation of the total derivative $\mathrm{D}F(\mathbf{p}): \R^n \to\R^m$. Thus, in this case, $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}: T_\mathbf{p}\R^n \to T_{F(\mathbf{p})} \R^m$ corresponds to the total derivative $\mathrm{D}F(\mathbf{p}):\R^n \to\R^m$, under our usual identification of Euclidean spaces with their tangent spaces. The same calcalulation applies if $U$ is an open subset of $H^n$ and $V$ is an open subset of $H^m$.

Consider the more general case of a smooth map $F:M\to N$ between smooth manifolds with or without boundary. Choosing smooth coordinate charts $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ containing $\mathbf{p}\in M$ and $(V,\psi)$ for $N$ containing $F(\mathbf{p})$, we obtain the coordinate representation $\tilde{F} = \psi\circ F\circ^{-1}: \varphi(U\cap F^{-1}(V)) \to\psi(V)$.

Let $\tilde{\mathbf{p}} = \varphi(\mathbf{p})$ denote the coordinate representation of $\mathbf{p}$. By the computation above, $\mathrm{d}\tilde{F}_{\tilde{\mathbf{p}}}$ is represented with respect to the standard coordinate bases by the Jacobian matrix of $\tilde{F}$ at $\tilde{\mathbf{p}}$. Using the factor that $F\circ\varphi^{-1} = \psi^{-1} \circ\tilde{F}$ we get 

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p}\right) =& \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p} \left(\mathrm{d}(\varphi^{-1})_{\tilde{\mathbf{p}}} \left( \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{\tilde{p}} \right) \right) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(\psi^{-1})_{\tilde{F}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})} \left(\mathrm{d}(\tilde{F})_{\tilde{\mathbf{p}}} \left( \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{\tilde{p}} \right) \right) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(\psi^{-1})_{\tilde{F}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})} \left( \frac{\partial\tilde{F}^j}{\partial x^i}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial y^j}\right|_{\tilde{F}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})} \right) \\
  =& \frac{\partial\tilde{F}^j}{\partial x^j}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial y^j}\right|_{F(\mathbf{p})}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is represented in coordinate bases by the Jacobian matrix of $F$. In the fact, the definition of the differential is formulated to give a coordinate-independent meaning to the Jacobian matrix.

### Change of coordinates

Suppose that $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ are two smooth charts on $M$ and $\mathbf{p}\in U \cap B$. Let us denote the coordinate functions of $\varphi$ by $(x^i)$ and those of $\psi$ by $(\hat{x}^i)$, such that the transition map $\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}: \varphi(U \cap V)\to \psi(U\cap V)$ can be written

$$
  \psi\circ\varphi^{-1} (\mathbf{x}) = \left(\hat{x}^i(\mathbf{x}) \right)_{i=1}^n 
$$

The differential $\mathrm{d}(\psi\circ\phi^{-1})_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}$ can be written

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}(\psi\circ\varphi^{-1})_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|\right) = \frac{\partial\hat{x}^j}{\partial x^i}(\varphi(\mathbf{p})) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial\hat{x}^j}\right|_{\psi(\mathbf{p})}
\end{align*}
$$

Using the definitions of coordinate vectors, we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
  \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} =& \mathrm{d}(\varphi^{-1})_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\right) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(\psi^{-1})_{\psi(\mathbf{p})} \circ \mathrm{d}(\psi\circ\varphi^{-1})_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})} \left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_{\varphi(\mathbf{p})}\right) \\
  =& \mathrm{d}(\psi^{-1})_{\psi(\mathbf{p})}\left(\frac{\partial\hat{x}^j}{\partial x^i} (\varphi(\mathbf{p})) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial \hat{x}^j}\right|_{\psi(\mathbf{p})} \right) \\
  =& \frac{\partial\tilde{x}^j}{\partial x^i} (\tilde{\mathbf{p}}) \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial\hat{x}^j}\right|
\end{align*}
$$

where $\tilde{\mathbf{p}} = \varphi(\mathbf{p})$. Applying this to the components of a vector $\mathbf{v} = v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} = \hat{v}^j \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial\hat{x}^j}\right|_\mathbf{p}$ we find that the components of $\mathbf{v}$ transform by the rule

$$
  \hat{v}^j = \frac{\partial\hat{x}^j}{\partial x^i}(\tilde{\mathbf{p}})v^i
$$

## Tangent bundle

<MathBox title='Tangent bundle' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ is a smooth manifold $M$ with or without boundary, the *tangent bundle* of $M$, denoted $TM$, is the disjoint union of the tangent spaces at all points of $M$:

$$
  TM := \bigsqcup_{\mathbf{p}\in M} T_\mathbf{p} M := \bigcup_{\mathbf{p}\in M} \Set{\mathbf{p}} \times T_\mathbf{p} M
$$

The tangent bundle is equipped with a natural *projection map* $\pi:TM \to M$, sending each vector in $T_\mathbf{p} M$ to the point $\mathbf{p}$ at which it is tangent, i.e. $\pi(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{p}$. 
</MathBox>

In the special case $M = \R^n$, the tangent bundle of $\R^n$ can be canonically identified with the union of its geometric tangent spaces, which in turn is just the Cartesian product of $\R^n$ with itself:

$$
\begin{align*}
  T\R^n =& \bigsqcup_{\mathbf{a}\in\R^n} T_\mathbf{a}\R^n \cong \bigsqcup_{\mathbf{a}\in\R^n} \R_\mathbf{a}^n \\
  =& \bigsqcup_{\mathbf{a}\in\R^n} \Set{\mathbf{a}} \times\R^n = \R^n \times\R^n
\end{align*}
$$

An element $(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{v})\in T\R^n$ of this Cartesian product can be thought of as representing either the geometric tangent vector $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{a}$ or the derivation $\mathrm{D}_\mathbf{v}|_\mathbf{a}$.

In general, the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold cannot be identified in any natural way with a Cartesian product, because there is no canonical way to identify tangent spaces at different points with each other.

<MathBox title='The tangent bundle is a smooth manifold' boxType='proposition'>
For any smooth $n$-manifold $M$, the tangent bundle $TM$ has a natural topology and smooth structure that make it into a $2n$-dimensional smooth manifold. With respect to this structure, the projection $\pi:TM\to M$ is smooth.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

$$
\begin{CD}
  \pi^{-1}(U) \subseteq TM @>\tilde{\varphi}>> @ \varphi(U)\times\R^n \subseteq \R^{2n} \\
  @V{\pi}VV @VVV \\
  U \subseteq M @>>\varphi> \varphi(U)\subseteq \R^n
\end{CD}
$$

Given any smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$, note that $\pi^{-1} (U)\subseteq TM$ is the set of all tangent vector to $M$ at all points of $U$. Let $(x^i)_{i=1}^n$ denote the coordinate functions of $\varphi$, and define a map $\tilde{\varphi}: \pi^{-1}(U)\to\R^{2n}$ by

$$
  \tilde{\varphi}\left(v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_\mathbf{p} \right) = \left(x^1(\mathbf{p}),\dots,x^n (\mathbf{p}),v^1,\dots,v^n \right)
$$

It image set is $\varphi(U)\times\R^n$ which is an open subset of $\R^{2n}$. It is a bijection onto its image, because its inverse can be written explicitly as

$$
  \tilde{\varphi}^{-1}(x^1,\dots,x^n,v^1,\dots,v^n) = v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_{\varphi^{-1}(\mathbf{x})}
$$

Suppose that we are given two smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ for $M$, and let $(\psi^{-1}(U), \tilde{\varphi})$ and $(\tilde^{-1}(V), \tilde{\psi})$ be the corresponding charts on $TM$. The sets

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{\varphi}\left(\pi^{-1}(U) \cap \pi^{-1}(V) \right) =& \varphi(U \cap V) \times\R^n \\
  \tilde{\psi}\left(\pi^{-1}(U) \cap \pi^{-1}(V) \right) =& \psi(U \cap V) \times\R^n
\end{align*}
$$

are open in $\R^{2n}$, and the transition map $\tilde{\psi}\circ\tilde{\varphi}^{-1}: \varphi(U\cap V)\times\R^n \to \psi(U\cap V)\times\R^n$ can be written as

$$
\begin{align*}
  &\tilde{psi}\circ\varphi^^{-1}(x^1,\dots,x^n,v^1,\dots,v^n) \\
  &= \left(\tilde{x}^1(\mathbf{x}),\dots,\tilde{x}^n(\mathbf{x}), \frac{\partial \tilde{x}^1}{\partial x^j}(\mathbf{x})v^j,\dots,\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^n}{\partial x^j}(\mathbf{x})v^j \right)
\end{align*}
$$

which is clearly smooth.

Choosing a countable cover $\Set{U_i}$ of $M$ by smooth coordinate domains, we obtain a countable cover of $TM$ by coordinate domains $\Set{\pi^{-1}(U_i)}$ satisfying the conditions of the smooth manifold chart lemma. To check the Hausdorff condition, note that any two points in the same fibre of $\pi$ lie in one chart, while if $(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{v})$ and $(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{w})$ lie in different fibers, there exits disjoint smooth coordinate domains $U$ and $V$ for $M$ such that $\mathbf{p}\in U$ and $\mathbf{q}\in V$, and then $\pi^{-1}(U)$ and $\pi^{-1}(V)$ are disjoint coordinate neighbourhoods containing $(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{v})$ and $(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{w})$, respectively.

To se that $\pi$ is smooth, note that with respect to the charts $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ and $(\pi^{-1}(U), \tilde{\varphi})$ for $TM$, its coordinate representation is $\pi(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{x}$.

If $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary, and $M$ can be covered by a single smooth chart, then $TM$ is diffeomorphic to $M\times\R^n$.

If $(U,\varphi)$ is a global smooth chart for $M$, then $\varphi$ is, in particular a diffeomorphism from $U = M$ to an open subset $\hat{U}\subseteq \R^n$ or $H^n$. The proof from the previous proposition showed that the natural coordinate chart $\tilde{\varphi}$ is a bijection from $TM$ for $\hat{U}\times\R^n$, and the smooth structure on $TM$ is defined essentially by declaring $\tilde{\varphi}$ to be a diffeomorphism.

Let $F:M\to N$ be a smooth map between smooth manifolds $M$ and $N$. By combining the differentials of $F$ at all points of $M$, we obtain a globally defined map $\mathrm{d}F: TM\to TN$ between tangent bundles, called the *global differential* or *global tangent map*. This is just the map whose restriction to each tangent space $T_\mathbf{p}M \subseteq TM$ is $\mathrm{d}F_p$.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
If $F: M\to N$ is a smooth map, its global differential $\mathrm{d}F: TM\to TN$ is a smooth map.

From the local expression for $\mathrm{d}F_p$ in coordinates, it follows that $\mathrm{d}F$ has the following coordinate representation in terms of natural coordinates for $TM$ and $TN$:

$$
  \mathbf{d}F(x^1,\dots,x^n,v^1,\dots^n) = \left(F^1(\mathbf{x}),\dots,F^n(\mathbf{x}),\frac{\partial F^1}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{x})v^i,\dots,\frac{\partial F^n}{\partial x^i}(\mathbf{x})v^i \right)
$$

This map is smooth, because $F$ is smooth.

## Velocity vectors of curves

<MathBox title='Curve and velocity' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ is a manifold with or without boundary, a *curve* in $M$ is a continuous map $\gamma: I\subseteq\R \to M$ where the interval $I\subseteq\R$ can be both open and closed.

If $\gamma$ is a smooth curve, the *velocity* of $\gamma$ at $t_0$ is defined as the tangent vector

$$
  \gamma'(t_0) = \mathrm{d}\gamma\left(\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t_0} \right) \in T_{\gamma(t_0)}M
$$

where $\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t_0}$ is the standard coordinate basis vector in $T_{t_0}\R$. This tangent vector acts on functions by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \gamma' (t_0)f =& \mathrm{d}\gamma\left(\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t_0} \right) = \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t_0} (f\circ\gamma) \\
  =& (f\circ\gamma)'(t_0)
\end{align*}
$$
</MathBox>

Let $(U,\varphi)$ be a smooth chart for a smooth $n$-manifold M with coordinate functions $(x^i)_{i=1}^n$. If $\gamma(t_0)\in U$, the coordinate representation of $\gamma$ is $\gamma(t) = (\gamma^i(t))_{i=1}^n$. The coordinate formula for the differential yields

$$
  \gamma'(t_0) = \frac{\mathrm{d}\gamma^i}{\mathrm{d}t}(t_0)\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_{\gamma(t_0)}
$$

This means that $\gamma'(t_0)$ is the tangent vector whose components in a coordinate basis are the derivatives of the component functions of $\gamma$.

<MathBox title='Tangent vectors are velocity vectors' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary and $\mathbf{p}\in M$. Every $\mathbf{v}\in T_\mathbf{p}M$ is the velocity of some smooth curve in $M$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

First, suppose that $\mathbf{p}\in\mathrm{int}(M)$. Let $(U,\varphi)$ be a smooth coordinate chart centered at $\mathbf{p}$, and write $\mathbf{v} = v^i \boldsymbol{\partial}_i |_\mathbf{p}$ in terms of the coordinate basis. For sufficiently small $\varepsilon > 0$, let $\gamma(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \to U$ be the curve with coordinate representation

$$
  \gamma(t) = (tv^i)_{i=1}^n
$$

This is a smooth curve with $\gamma(0) = \mathbf{p}$, and from the coordinate represenation of $\gamma'$ we get $\gamma'(0) = v^i \boldsymbol{\partial}_i |_{\gamma(0)} = \mathbf{v}$.

Next, suppose that $\mathbf{p}\in\partial M$. In this case, $\gamma(t) = (tv^i)_{i=1}^n$ only represents a point in $M$ when $tv^n \geq 0$. We can accommadate this by suitably restricting the domain of $\gamma$:
- if $v^n = 0$, we define $\gamma:(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon)\to U$ as before
- if $v^n >0$, we let the domain be $[0, \varepsilon)$
- if $v^n < 0$, we let the domain be $(-\varepsilon, 0]$

In each case, $\gamma$ is a smooth curve in $M$ with $\gamma(0) = \mathbf{p}$ and $\gamma'(0) = \mathbf{v}$.

## Alternative definitions of the tangent space

### Derivations of the space of germs

<MathBox title='Germ' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. A *smooth function element* on $M$ is an ordered pair $(f,U)$ where $U$ is an open subset of $M$ and $f:U\to\R$ is a smooth function.

For two function elements, we define an equivalence relation $(f,U)\sim_\mathbf{p} (g, V)$ if $f \equiv g$ on some neighbourhood of a point $\mathbf{p}\in M$. The equivalence class of a function element $(f,U)$, denoted $[(f,U)]_\mathbf{p}$, is called the *germ* of $f$ at $\mathbf{p}$. The set of all germs of smooth functions at $\mathbf{p}$ is denoted $C_\mathbf{p}^\infty (M)$. It is a real vector space and an associative algebra under the operations

- **(scalar multiplication):** $c[(f,U)]_\mathbf{p} = [(cf, U)]_\mathbf{p}$
- **(addition):** $[(f,U)]_\mathbf{p} + [(f + g, U\cap V)]_\mathbf{p}$
- **(multiplication):** $[(f,U)]_\mathbf{p} \cdot [(g,V)]_\mathbf{p} = [(fg, U\cap V)]$

A *derivation* of $C_\mathbf{p}^\infty$ is a linear map $v:C_\mathbf{p}^\infty (M) \to\R$ satisfying the product rule

$$
  v[fg]_\mathbf{p} = f(\mathbf{p})v[g]_\mathbf{p} + g(\mathbf{p})v[f]_\mathbf{p}
$$
</MathBox>

It is common to define the tangent space to $M$ at $\mathbf{p}$ as the vector space $D_\mathbf{p} M$ of derivations of $C_\mathbf{p}^\infty(M)$. The map $\phi: D_\mathbf{p}M \to T_\mathbf{p} M$ defined by $(\varphi\mathbf{v})f = \mathbf{v}([f]_\mathbf{p})$ is an isomorphism.

### Equivalence classes of curves

<MathBox title='Tangent space' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional smooth manifold and let $p\in M$. The set of all curves in $M$ passing through $p$ is defined as

$$
  C_p (M) := \Set{ \gamma:(-\varepsilon, \epsilon) \to M | \gamma \textrm{ differentiable } \gamma(0) = p }
$$

For any chart $h: U\subseteq M \to\R^n$ there is an equivalence relation

$$
  \gamma\sim\alpha :\iff (\h\circ\gamma)'(0) = (h\circ\alpha)'(0)
$$

The equivalence class $[\gamma]_\sim := \Set{\alpha | \gamma\sim\alpha }$ represents a tangent vector. The tangent space of $M$ at $p$, denoted $T_p M$ is defined as the set of all tangent vectors at $p$

$$
  T_p M := C_p(M)/\sim
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Coordinate basis' boxType='definition'>
Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional smooth manifold having a chart $h:U\subseteq M \to \R^n$ with inverse $\phi = h^{-1}$. Since the tangent space $T_p M$ is isomorphic to $\R^n$ there is a linear and bijective map $h_* : T_p M \to \R^n$ given by $[\gamma]\mapsto (h\circ\gamma)'(0)$ where the equivalence class $[\gamma]$ is a tangent vector in $T_p M$. The coordinate basis with respect to $h$ is defined as

$$
  \partial_j := \phi_* (e_j)
$$

where $\phi_* := h_*^{-1}$ and $(e_i)_{i=1}^n$ is the standard basis of $\R^n$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Differential' boxType='definition'>
Let $M, N$ be two smooth manifolds and let $f:M\to N$ be a smooth function. The differential of $f$ at $p\in M$ is defined as

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}f_p:& T_p M \to T_{f(p)} \\
  & [\gamma] \mapsto [f\circ\gamma]
\end{align*}
$$

The differential of $f$ is defined as

$$
  \mathrm{d}f: p\mapsto\mathrm{d}f_p

### Regular value theorem

In the following discussion, let $M, N$ be smooth manifolds of dimension $m$ and $n$ with $m\geq n$. Recall that $M, N$ are smooth manifolds if there are diffeomorphisms $\varphi:M\to\R^m$ and $\psi:N\to\R^n$.

<MathBox title='Critical point and regular value' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $f:M\to N$ is a smooth map. A point $p\in M$ is called a critical point of $f$ if the differential of $f$ at $p$, denoted $\mathrm{d}f_p$, is not surjective. Equivalently, the Jacobian of the map $\psi\circ f\phi^{-1}: \R^n \to\R^M$ has not maximal rank, i.e.

$$
  \mathrm{rank}f_p := \mathrm{rank}\left( J_{\psi\circ f\phi^{-1}} [h(p)] \right) < n
$$

A point $q\in N$ is called a regular value $f$ if $f^{-1}[\Set{q}]\in M$ does not contain critical points.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Regular value theorem' boxType='theorem'>
Let $M, N$ be smooth manifolds of dimension $m$ and $n$ with $m\geq n$. Suppose that $f:M\to N$ is a smooth map, and $q\in N$ be a regular value of $f$. Then $f^{-1}[\Set{q}]$ is a $(m-n)$-dimensional submanifold of $M$.
</MathBox>

### Tangent space

<MathBox title='Tangent spaces of submanifolds' boxType='definition'>
Let $M\subseteq\R^n$ be a $k$-dimensional submanifold. Then there is a chart $(U, h)$ of $\R^n$ such that

$$
  h(M\cap U) = \left( \R^k \times \mathbf{0}_{n-k} \right) \cap U'
$$

Since $h$ is a homemorphism, we may form an inverse $\phi: \R^k \cap U \to M\cap U$ giving a local parametrization. The tangent space for $p\in M$ is defined as

$$
  \mathrm{T}_p M := \mathrm{d}\phi_\tilde{p} [\R^k] = \Set{ J_\phi \left( \phi^{-1}(p)x \right) | x\in\R^k } \subseteq\R^n 
$$

The tangent space can be reformulated in terms of a parametrized curve $\gamma:\R\to M$

$$
  \mathrm{T}_p M = \Set{ \gamma'(0) | \gamma:(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \to M \textrm{ differentiable with } \gamma(0) = p }
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

To prove the reformulation, first let $v \in \mathrm{T}_p M$ such that $v = J_\phi\left(\tilde{p} \right)x$ with $\tilde{p} = \phi^{-1}(p)$ and $x\in\R^k$. Then for $\tilde{\gamma}(t) = \tilde{p} + tx$

$$
\begin{align}
  v &= J_\phi \left(\tilde{\gamma}(0) right)\tilde{\gamma}(0) \\
  &= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\gamma \circ \tilde{\gamma} \right)|_{t=0} = \gamma'
\end{align}
$$

This shows that $T_p M \subseteq \Set{ \gamma'(0) | \gamma:(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \to M \textrm{ differentiable with } \gamma(0) = p }$

Finally, let $\gamma: (-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \to M$ differentiable with $\gamma (0) = p$. Since $M$ is a submanifold, there is a chart $h: U\cap M \to \R^k \cap U'$, which defines an inverse of $\phi$. Define $x:= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} (h \circ \gamma)|_{t=0}$ so that $\tilde{\gamma} = h\circ \gamma$. Then

$$
\begin{align}
  \gamma'(0) &= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\phi \circ \gamma)\right)|_{t=0} \\
  &= J_\phi \left(\tilde{\gamma}(0) \right)\tilde{\gamma}'(0) = J_\phi \left(\phi^{-1}(p)\right)x
\end{align}
$$

This shows that $T_p M \supseteq \Set{ \gamma'(0) | \gamma:(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \to M \textrm{ differentiable with } \gamma(0) = p }$

# Submersions, immersions and embeddings

<MathBox title='Rank' boxType='definition'>
Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary. Given a smooth map $F:M\to N$ and a point $\mathbf{p}\in M$, we define the *rank* of $F$ at $\mathbf{p}$ to be the rank of the linear map $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}:T_\mathbf{p}M \to T_{F(\mathbf{p})}N$, which is the rank of the Jacobian matrix of $F$ in any smooth smooth chart, or the dimension of $\mathrm{ran}(\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}) \subseteq T_{F(\mathbf{p})} N$. 

The rank of $F$ at each point bounded above by $\min\Set{\dim(M),\dim(N)}$. If the rank of $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is equal to this upper bound, then $F$ has full rank at $\mathbf{p}$, and if $F$ has full rank everywhere, we say that $F$ has *full rank*. If $F$ has the same rank at every point, we say that is has constant rank.

A smooth map $F:M\to N$ is called a *smooth submersion* if its differential is surjective at each point, i.e. $\mathrm{rank}(F) = \dim(N)$. It is called a *smooth immersion* if its differential is injective at each point, i.e. $\mathrm{rank}(F) = \dim(M)$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose that $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map and $\mathbf{p}\in M$. If $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is surjective, then $\mathbf{p}$ has a neighbourhood $U$ such that $F|_U$ is a submersion. If $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is injective, then $\mathbf{p}$ has a neigbourhood $U$ such that $F|_U$ is an immersion.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If we choose any smooth coordinate for $M$ near $\mathbf{p}$ and for $N$ near $F(\mathbf{p})$, either hypothesis mean that the Jacobian matrix of $F$ in coordinates has full rank at $\mathbf{p}$. If $\dim(M)= m$ and $\dim(N) = n$, the set of $m\times n$ matrices of full rank is an open subset of $\mathcal{M}_{m,n}(\mathbb{R})$. By continuity, the Jacobian of $F$ has full rank in some neighbourhood of $\mathbf{p}$.

## Local diffeomorphism

<MathBox title='Local diffeomorphism' boxType='definition'>
If $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, a map $F:M\to N$ is called a *local diffeomorphism* if every point $p\in M$ has a neighbourhood $U$ such that $F(U)$ is open in $N$ and $F|_U:U\to F(U)$ is a diffeomorphism.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Inverse function theorem for manifolds' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that  $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds, and let $F:M\to N$ be a smooth map. If $\mathbf{p}\in M$ is a point such that $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is invertible, then there are connected neighbourhoods $U_0$ of $\mathbf{p}$ and $V_0$ of $F(\mathbf{p})$ such that $F|_U:U_0 \to V_0$ is a diffeomorphism.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The fact that $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is bijective implies that $M$ and $N$ have the same dimension, say $n$. Choose smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$ and $(V,\psi)$ centered at $F(\mathbf{p})$ with $F(U) \subseteq V$. Then $\tilde{F} = \psi\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is a smooth map from the open subset $\tilde{U} = \varphi(U)\subseteq\R^n$ into $\tilde{V} = \psi(V)\subseteq\R^n$ with $\tilde{F}(\mathbf{p}) = 0$. Because $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are diffeomorphisms, the differential $\mathrm{d}\tilde{F}_0 = \mathrm{d}_{\psi_{F(\mathbf{p})}} \circ \mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p} \circ \mathrm{d}(\varphi^{-1})_0$ is nonsingular. The ordinary inverse function theorem shows that there are connected open subsets $\tilde{U}_0 \subseteq\tilde{U}$ and $\tilde{V}_0 \subseteq\tilde{V}$ containing $0$ such that $\tilde{F}$ restricts to a diffemorphism from $\tilde{U}_0$ to $\tilde{V}_0$. Then $U_0 = \varphi^{-1} (\tilde{U}_0)$ and $V_0 = \psi^{-1}(\tilde{V}_0)$ are connected neighbourhoods of $\mathbf{p}$ and $F(\mathbf{p})$, respectively, and it follows by composition that $F|_{U_0}$ is a diffeomorphism from $U_0$ to $V_0$.

Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds without boundary, and that $F:M\to N$ is a map.
1. $F$ is a local diffeomorphism if and only if it is both a smooth immersion and a smooth submersion.
2. If $\dim(M) = \dim(N)$ and $F$ is neither a smooth immersion or a smooth submersion, then it is a local diffemorphism.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Suppose first that $F$ is a local diffeomorpism. Given $\mathbf{p}\in M$ there is a neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathbf{p}$ such that $F$ is a diffeomorphism from $U$ to $F(U)$. It follows that $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}:T_\mathbf{p}M\to T_{F(\mathbf{p})} N$ is an isomorphism. Thus, $\mathrm{rank}(F) = \dim(M) = \dim(N)$, so $F$ is both a smooth immersion and a smooth submersion.

Conversely, if $F$ is both a smooth immersion and a smooth submersion, then $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ is an isomorphism at each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, and the inverse function theorem for manifolds shows that $\mathbf{p}$ has a neighbourhood on which $F$ restricts to a diffeomorphism onto its image.

**(2):** Note that if $M$ and $N$ have the same dimension, then either injectivity or surjectivity of $\mathrm{d}F_\mathbf{p}$ implies bijectivity, so $F$ is a smooth submersion if and only if it is a smooth immersion, and thus **(2)** follows from **(1)**.

## The rank theorem

<MathBox title='Rank theorem' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds of dimensions $m$ and $n$, respectively, and that $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map with constant rank $\mathrm{rank}(F) = r$. For each $\mathbf{p}\in M$, there exists smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$ and $(V,\psi)$ for $N$ centered at $F(\mathbf{p})$ such that $F(U) \subseteq V$, in which $F$ has a coordinate representation of the form

$$
  \tilde{F}(x^1,\dots,x^r,x^{r+1},\dots,x^m) = (x^1,\dots,x^r,0,\dots,0)
$$

In particular, if $F$ is a smooth submersion, this becomes

$$
  \tilde{F}(x^1,\dots,x^n,x^{n+1},\dots,x^m) = (x^1,\dots,x^n)
$$

and if $F$ is a smooth immersion, it is

$$
  \tilde{F}(x^1,\dots,\dots,x^m) = (x^1,\dots,x^m,0,\dots,0)
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Because the theorem is local, after choosing smooth coordinates we can replace $M$ and $N$ by open subsets $U\subseteq\R^m$ and $V\subseteq\R^n$. The fact that $\mathrm{D}F(\mathbf{p})$ has rank $r$ implies that its matrix has some $r\times r$ submatrix with nonzero determinant. By reordering the coordinates, we may assume that it is the upper left submatrix, $\left(\frac{\partial F^i}{\partial x^j}\right)$ for $i,j=1,\dots,r$. 

Let us relabel the standard coordinates as $(x, y) = (x^1,\dots,x^r, y^1,\dots,y^{m-r})$ in $\R^n$ and $(v,w) = (v^1,\dots,v^r,w^1,\dots,w^{n-r})$ in $\R^n$. By initial translations of the coordinates, we may assume without loss of generality that $\mathbf{p} = (0, 0)$ and $F(\mathbf{p}) = (0,0)$. If we write $F(x,y) = (Q(x,y), R(x,y))$ for some smooth maps $Q: U\to\R^r$ and $R:U\to\R^{n-r}$, then our hypothesis is that $\left(\frac{\partial Q^i}{\partial x^j}\right)$ is nonsingular at $(0,0)$.

Define $\varphi:U\to\R^m$ by $\varphi(x,y) = (Q(x,y), y)$. Its total derivative at $(0,0)$ is

$$
  \mathrm{D}\varphi(0,0) = \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial Q^i}{\partial x^j}(0,0) & \frac{\partial Q^i}{\partial y^j}(0,0) \\
    0 & \delta_j^i
  \end{bmatrix}
$$

The matrix $\mathrm{D}\varphi(0,0)$ is nonsingular by virtue of the hypothesis. Thus, by the inverse function theorem, there are connected neighbourhoods $U_0$ of $(0,0)$ and $\tilde{U}_0$ of $\varphi(0,0) = (0,0)$ such that $\varphi:U_0\to\tilde{U}_0$ is a diffemorphism. By shrinking $U_0$ and $\tilde{U}_0$ if necessary, we may assume that $\tilde{U}_0$ is an open cube. Writing the inverse map as $\varphi^{-1}(x,y) = (A(x,y), B(x,y))$ for some smooth functions $A:\tilde{U}_0 \to \R^r$ and $B:\tilde{U}_0 \to\R^{m-r}$, we get

$$
\begin{align*}
  (x,y) =& \varphi(A(x,y), B(x,y)) \\
  =& (Q(A(x,y), B(x,y)), B(x,y))
\end{align*}
$$

Comparing $y$ components shows that $B(x,y) = y$ and therefore $\varphi^{-1}$ has the form

$$
  \varphi^{-1}(x,y) = (A(x,y),y)
$$

On the other hand, $\varphi\circ\varphi^{-1} = \mathrm{id}$ implies that $Q(A(x,y),y)$ = x, and therefore $F\circ\varphi^{-1}$ has the form

$$
  F\circ\varphi^{-1}(x,y) = (x, \tilde{R}(x,y))
$$

where $\tilde{R}:\tilde{U}_0 \to\R^{n-r}$ is defined by $\tilde{R}(x,y) = R(A(x,y), y)$. The Jacobian matrix fo this composite map at an arbitrary point $(x,y)\in\tilde{U}$ is

$$
  \mathrm{D}(F\circ \varphi^{-1})(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}
    \delta_j^i & 0 \\
    \frac{\partial\tilde{R}^i}{\partial x^j}(x,y) & \frac{\partial\tilde{R}^i}{\partial y^j} (x,y)
  \end{bmatrix}
$$

Since composing with a diffemorphism does not change the rank of a map, this matrix has rank $r$ everywhere in $\tilde{U}_0$. The first $r$ columns are obviously linearly independent, so the rank can be $r$ on if the derivatives $\frac{\partial\tilde{R}^i}{\partial y^j}$ vanish identically on $\tilde{U}_0$, which implies that $\tilde{R}$ is independent of $(y^1,\dots,y^{m-r})$. Thus, if we let $S(x) = \tilde{R}(x,0)$, then we have

$$
  F\circ\varphi^{-1}(x,y) = (x, S(x))
$$

To complete the proof, we need to define an appropriate smooth chart in some neighbourhood of $(0,0)\in V$. Let $V_0 \subseteq V$ be the open subset defined by $V_0 = \Set{(v,w)\in V | (v,0)\in\tilde{U}_0}$. Then $V_0$ is a neighbourhood of $(0,0)$. Because $\tilde{U}_0$ is a cube and $F\circ\varphi^{-1}$ has the form above, it follows that $F\circ \varphi^{-1}(\tilde{U}_0) \subseteq V_0$, and therefore $F(U_0)\subseteq V_0$. Define $\psi:V_0 \to\R^n$ by $\psi(v,w) = (v, w - S(v))$. This is a diffeomorphism onto its image, because its inverse is given explicitly by $\psi^{-1}(s,t) = (s,t + S(s))$. Thus, $(V_0, \psi)$ is a smooth chart. It follows that 

$$
\begin{align*}
  \psi\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1} (x,y) =& \psi(x, S(x)) \\
  =& (x, S(x) - S(x)) = (x,0)
\end{align*}
$$

which was to be proved.

First, suppose that $F$ has a linear coordinate representation in a neighbourhood of each point. Since every linear map has constant rank, it follows that the rank of $F$ is constant in a neighbourhood of each point, and thus by connectedness it is constant on all of $M$.

2. if $F$ is injective, then it is a smooth immersion
3. if $F$ is bijective, then it is a diffeomorphism

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\dim(M) = m$ and $\dim(N) = n$, and suppose $\mathrm{rank}(F) = r$ is constant.

**(1):** Assume that $F$ is not a smooth submersion, which means that $r < n$. By the rank theorem, for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$ there are smooth charts $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ centered at $\mathbf{p}$ and $(V,\psi)$ for $N$ centered at $F(\mathbf{p})$ such that $F(U) \subseteq V$ and the coordinate representation of $F$ is given by the rank theorem, Shrinking $U$ if necessary, we may assume that it is a regular coordinate ball and $F(\overline(U))\subseteq V$. This implies that $F(\overline{U})$ is a compact subset of the set $\Set{y\in V | y^{r+1} = \cdots = y^n = 0}$, so it is closed in $N$ and contains no open subset of $N$; hence it is nowhere dense in $N$. Since very open cover of a manifold has a countable subcover, we can choose countably many such charts $\Set{(U_i,\varphi_i)}$ covering $M$, with corresponding charts $\Set{(V_i,\psi_i)}$ covering $F(M)$. Because $F(M)$ is equal to the countable union of the nowhere dense sets $F(\overline{U}_i)$, it follows from the Baire category theorem that $F(M)$ has empty interior in $N$, meaning that $F$ cannot be surjective.

**(2):** Asuume that $F$ is not a smooth immersion, so that $r < m$. By the rank theorem, for each $\mathbf{p}\in M$ we can choose charts on neighbourhoods of $\mathbf{p}$ and $F(\mathbf{p})$ in which $F$ has the coordinate representation given by the rank theorem. It follows that $F(0,\dots,0,\varepsilon) = F(0,\dots,0,0)$ for any sufficiently small $varepislon$, so $F$ is not injective.

**(3):**  This follows from **(1)** and **(2)**, because a bijective smooth map of constant rank is a smooth submersion by part **(1)** and a smooth immersion by part **(2)**. It follows that $F$ is a local diffeomorphism, and because it is bijective, it is a diffeomorphism.

### Rank theorem for manifolds with boundary

<MathBox title='Local immersion theorem for manifolds with boundary' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose that $M$ is a smooth $m$-manifold with boundary, $N$ is a smooth $n$-manifold, and $F:M\to N$ is a smooth immersion. For any $\mathbf{p}\in\partial M$, there exist a smooth boundary chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ centered at $p$ and a smooth coordinate chart $(V,\psi)$ for $N$ centered at $F(\mathbf{p})$ with $F(U)\subseteq V$, in which $F$ has the coordinate representation

$$
  \hat{F}(x^1,\dots,x^m) = (x^1,\dots,x^m,0,\dots,0)
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

By choosing initial smooth charts for $M$ and $N$, we may assume that $M$ and $N$ are open subsets of $H^m$ and $\R^n$, respectively, and also that $\mathbf{p} = 0 \in H^m$ and $F(\mathbf{p}) = 0\in\R^n$. By definition os smoothness for functions on $H^m$, it follows that $F$ extends to a smooth map $\tilde{F}:W\to\R^n$, where $W$ is some open subset of $\R^m$ containing $0$. Because $\mathrm{d}\tilde{F}_0 = \mathrm{d}F_0$ is injective, by shrinking $W$ if necessary, we may assume that $\tilde{F}$ is a smooth immersion. Let us write coordintes on $\R^m$ as $x = (x^i)_{i=1}^m$ and those on $\R$ as $(v,w) = (v^1,0\dots,v^m, w^1,\dots,w^{n-m})$.

By the rank theorem, there exist smooth charts $(U_0, \varphi_0)$ for $\R^m$ centered at $0$ and $(V_0,\psi_0)$ for $\R^n$ centered at $0$ such that $\hat{F} = \psi_0 \circ\tilde{F}\circ\varphi_0^{-1}$ is given by the coordinate representation in the hypothesis. The only problem with these coordinates is that $\varphi_0$ might not restrict to a boundary chart for $M$. But we can correct this easily as follow. 

Because $\varphi_0$ is a diffeomorphism from $U_0$ to an open subset $\hat{U}_0 = \psi_0(U_0)\subseteq\R^m$, the map $\varphi_0^{-1} \times\mathrm{id}_{\R^{n-m}}$ is a diffeomorphism from $\tilde{U}_0 \times\R^{n-m}$ to $U_0 \times\R^{n-m}$. Let $\psi = (\varphi_0^{-1} \times \mathrm{id}_{\R^{n-m}}) \circ\varphi_0$, which is a diffeomorphism from some open subset $V\subseteq V_0$ containing $0$ to a neighbourhood of $0$ in $\R^n$. Using the hypothesis coordinate representation, we compute

$$
\begin{align*}
  \psi\circ F(x) =& \left(\varphi_0^{-1} \times\mathrm{id}_{\R^{n-m}} \right) \circ\varphi_0 \circ F \circ\varphi_0^{-1} \circ\varphi_0(x) \\
  =& \left(\varphi_0^{-1} \times\mathrm{id}_{\R^{n-m}} \right) \circ \hat{F}(\varphi_0(x)) \\
  =& \left(\varphi_0^{-1} \times\mathrm{id}_{\R^{n-m}} \right)(\varphi(x),0) = (x,0)
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the original coordinates for $M$ (restricted to a sufficiently small neighbourhood of $0$) and the chart $(V,\psi)$ for $N$ satisfy the desired conditions.

## Embeddings

# Riemannian manifolds

A Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ is a smooth symmetric covariant $2$-tensor field (bilinear form) on $M$ that is positive definitive at each point. A Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ is a smooth manifold $M$ endowed with a Riemannian metric $g$.

## Riemannian metric

If $g$ is a Riemannian metric on $M$, then for each $p \in M$, the $2$-tensor $g_p$ is an inner product on $T_p M$. In any smooth local coordinates $\left( x^i \right)$, a Riemannian metric can be written

$$
\begin{align*}
  g &= g_{ij} \mathrm{d}x^i \otimes \mathrm{d}x^j \\
  &= \frac{1}{2} \left( g_{ij} \mathrm{d}x^i \otimes \mathrm{d}x^j + g_{ji} \mathrm{d}x^i \otimes \mathrm{d}x^j  \right) \\
  &= \frac{1}{2} \left( g_{ij} \mathrm{d}x^i \otimes \mathrm{d}x^j + g_{ij} \mathrm{d}x^j \otimes \mathrm{d}x^i  \right) \\
  &= g_{ij} \mathrm{d}x^i \mathrm{d}x^j 
\end{align*}
$$

where $(g_{ij})$ is a symmetric positive definitive matrix of smooth functions.
