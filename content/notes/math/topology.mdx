# Topological space

Topological spaces are an abstraction of metric spaces. 

<MathBox title='Topological space' boxType='definition'>
Let $X$ be a set with power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$. A topology on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ of subsets of $X$, called open subsets, satisfying

1. $\emptyset, X \in \mathcal{T}$
2. $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under arbitrary union: $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}\implies\bigcup A \in \mathcal{T}$
3. $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under finite intersection: $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T} \land \mathcal{A}\text{ is finite } \implies \bigcap \mathcal{A} \in \mathcal{T}$

The pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called a topological space. A subset $C\subseteq X$ is called closed in $(X,\mathcal{T})$ if its complement is open, i.e. $X\setminus C \in\mathcal{T}$. Note that $X$ and $\emptyset$ are both open and closed.
</MathBox>

A topology can similarly be constructed from collections of closed sets, as captured in the following proposition.

<MathBox title='Closed set topology' boxType='proposition'>
Given a set $X$, then $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ is the collection of closed sets for a topology on $X$ if and only if

1. $\emptyset, X \in \mathcal{X}$
2. $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under arbitrary intersection: $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C}\implies\bigcap A \in \mathcal{C}$
3. $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under finite union: $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C} \land \mathcal{A}\textrm{ is finite } \implies \bigcup \mathcal{A} \in \mathcal{C}$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Note that $\mathcal{T} = \Set{U^c | U\in\mathcal{C}}$ defines a collection of open sets that satsify the axioms of a topology
1. since $\emptyset, X\in\mathcal{T}$ and $\emptyset = X^c$, then $\emptyset, X\in\mathcal{C}$
2. for an arbitrary collection $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$ we know that $\bigcup\mathcal{A}\in\mathcal{T}$. Taking the complement of the union and applying DeMorgan's law gives
$$
  \left( \bigcup\mathcal{A} \right)^c &= \bigcap \Set{ A^c | A\in\mathcal{A} } \in\mathcal{C}
$$
3. for an arbitrary collection $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, then $\bigcup\mathcal{A}\in\mathcal{T}$. Noting that $\mathcal{A}^c = \Set{A^c | A\in\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$. Applying DeMorgan's law shows that $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under arbitrary intersection
$$
  \left( \bigcup\mathcal{A} \right)^c = \bigcap \Set{ A^c | A\in\mathcal{A} } = \bigcap \mathcal{A}^c \in\mathcal{C}
$$
4. for a finite collection $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, then $\bigcap\mathcal{A}\in\mathcal{T}$. Noting that $\mathcal{A}^c = \Set{A^c | A\in\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$. Applying DeMorgan's law shows that $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under finite union
$$
  \left( \bigcap\mathcal{A} \right)^c = \bigcup \Set{ A^c | A\in\mathcal{A} } = \bigcup \mathcal{A}^c \in\mathcal{C}
$$

<MathBox title='Neighbourhood' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a point $x\in X$. A neighbourhood of $x$ is a subset $V\subseteq X$ that includes an open set $U\subseteq X$ containing $x$, i.e.

$$
  x \in U\subseteq V\subseteq X
$$

The neighbourhood $V$ need not be open.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space. A set $U\subseteq X$ is open if and only if $U$ is a neighbourhood of every $x\in U$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $U$ is open, then it is clearly a neighbourhood of every $x\in U$. Conversely, suppose $U$ is a neighbourhood of every $x\in U$. Then by definition, for every $x\in U$ there is an open set $\x \in U_x \subseteq U$. Then $\bigcup_{x\in U} U_x = U$ is also open.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Closure' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. The closure of $S$, denoted $\mathrm{cl}(S) \equiv \overline{S}$ is the intersection of all closed subsets of $X$ containing $S$

$$
  \overline{S} := \Set{\bigcap C \subseteq X | C\textrm{ is closed and }S\subseteq C }
$$

This is the smallest closed set containing $S$.
1. $\overline{S}$ is closed
2. $S\subseteq\overline{S}$
3. if $C$ is closed and $S\subseteq C$ then $\overline{S}\subseteq C$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Interior' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. Then $p\in S$ is called an interior point of $S$ if and only if there is an open set $U\in\mathcal{T}$ such that $p\in U$ and $U \subseteq S$. The interior of $S$, denoted $\mathrm{int}(S) \equiv \mathbb{S}^0$, is the set of all interior points of $S$. Equivalently, $\mathrm{Int}(S)$, is defined as the union of all open subsets of $X$ contained in $S$.

$$
  \mathrm{int}(S) := \Set{\bigcup U\subseteq X | U\textrm{ is open and }U\subseteq S }
$$

This set is the largest open subset of $S$:
1. $\mathrm{int}(S)$ is open
2. $\mathrm{int}(S)\subseteq S$
3. if $U$ is open and $U\subseteq S$, then $U\subseteq\mathrm{int}(S)$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Exterior' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. Then $p\in S$ is called an extorior point of $S$ if and only if there is an open set $U \in \mathcal{T}$ such that $p \in U$ and $U \subseteq X\setminus S$. The extorior of $S$, denoted $\mathrm{ext}(S)$, is the set of all extorior points of $S$. Equivalently, $\mathrm{ext}(S)$ is the is the union of all open subsets of $X$ contained in $X \setminus S$, i.e. disjoint from $S$.

$$
  \mathrm{ext}(S) := \Set{\bigcup U\subseteq X | U\textrm{ is open and }U\subseteq X\setminus S }
$$

This is the largest open set disjoint from $S$. The exterior is the interior of of the complement of $S$

$$
  \mathrm{ext}(S) = \mathrm{int}(X\setminus S) = X\setminus\overline{S}
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Boundary' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. Then $p\in S$ is called a boundary point of $S$ if and only if for all open sets $U \in \mathcal{T}$ with $p \in U$ then $U \cap S \neq \emptyset$ and $U \cap (X\setminus S) \neq \emptyset$. The boundary of $S$, denoted $\partial S$, is the set off all boundary points of $S$. Equivalently

$$
  \partial S := \overline{S}\setminus\mathrm{int}(S)
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Derived set' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, and consider a subset $S\subseteq X$. Then $p\in S$ is an accumulation point of $S$ if and only if for all open sets $U \in \mathcal{T}$ with $p \in U$ then $U\setminus \Set{ p } \cap S \neq \emptyset$. The derived set of $S$, denoted $S'$, is the set of all accumulation points of $S$.
</MathBox>

## Partial order

<MathBox title='Topological partial order' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $X$ is a set, and that $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are topologies on $X$. If $\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{T}$ is finer than $\mathcal{S}$, and $\mathcal{S}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}$. *Coarser than* ($\subseteq$) defines a partial order on the collection of topologies on $X$. That is, if $\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{T}$ are topologies on $X$, then this partial order has the following properties
1. reflexivity: $\mathcal{R}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{R}$
2. anti-symmetry: if $\mathcal{R}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{S}$, and $\mathcal{S}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{R}$, then $\mathcal{R} = \mathcal{S}$
3. transitivity: if $\mathcal{R}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ is coarser that $\mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{R}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}$
</MathBox>

## Separation

Separation properties refer to the ability to separate points or sets with disjoint open sets. Separated spaces are known as Hausdorff spaces.

<MathBox title='Hausdorff space (separated space)' boxType='definition'>
A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called a Hausdorff space if for every pair of distinct points $p, q \in X$, there exist disjoint open subsets $U, V \subseteq X$, ie. $U \cap V = \emptyset$ such that $p \in U$ and $q \in V$. A Hausdorff space guarantees the uniqueness of limits of sequences.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Regular space' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A closed set $A\subseteq X$ and a point $x\in A^c$ can be separated if there exist disjoint open sets $U, V\in\mathcal{T}$ with $A\subseteq U$ and $x\in V$. If every nonempty closed set $A$ and point $x\in A^c$ can be separated, then $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called a regular space. 
</MathBox>

## Basis

<MathBox title='Base' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A collection of open subsets $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$ is called a basis (base) of $\mathcal{T}$ if every set in $\mathcal{T}$ can be written as a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$

$$
  \forall T\in\mathcal{T}: \bigcup_{i \in I} B_i \subseteq\mathcal{B} = T
$$

where $I$ is an index set.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Base properties' boxType='proposition'>
Let $X$ be a nonempty set. A collection of open subsets $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a base for a topology on $X$ if and only if
1. $X = \bigcup\mathcal{B}$
2. if $A,B\in\mathcal{B}$ and $x\in A\cap B$, there exists $C\in\mathcal{B}$ with $x\in C\subseteq A\cap B$

The second condition can be more weakly stated as
2. if $A, B\in\mathcal{B}$, then $A\cap B\in\mathcal{B}$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose $\mathcal{B}$ is a base for a topology on $X$. Since $X$ is open, $X$ is a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$. Since every set in $\mathcal{B}$ is a subset of $X$, we must have $X=\bigcup\mathcal{B}$. Suppose $A,B\in\mathcal{B}$ and that $x\in A\cap B$. Since $A\cap B$ is open, it's a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$. The point $x$ must be in one of those sets, so there exists $C\in\mathcal{B}$ with $x\in C\subseteq A\cap B$.
</details>
</MathBox>

A neighbourhood basis at $p \in X$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}_p$ of neighbourhoods of $p$ such that every neighbourhood of $p$ contains at least one $B \in \mathcal{B}_p$.

A topological set $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is first-countable if there is a countable neighbourhood basis at each point, and second-countable if there is a countable basis of $\mathcal{T}$. Since a countable basis of $\mathcal{T}$ contains a countable neighbourhood basis at each point, second-countability implies first-countability. A set is called countable if it admits a bijection with the set of natural numbers.

### Examples

For a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ induced by a metric $(X, d)$, the basis of $\mathcal{T}$ is

$$
  \mathcal{B} = \Set{ B_\varepsilon (x) | x \in X, \, \varepsilon > 0 }
$$

## Compactness (finite covers)

<MathBox title='Cover' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A cover of $X$ is a collection of subsets $\mathcal{C} = \Set{ U_i }_{i\in I}$, for some index set $I$, whose union is the whole space $X$, i.E

$$
  \bigcup \mathcal{C} = \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i = X
$$

The collection $\mathcal{C}$ is said to cover a subspace $A\subseteq X$ if

$$
  A \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{C} = \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i
$$

We call $\mathcal{C}$ an open cover if all its members are open subsets, i.e. $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, and we call $\mathcal{C}$ a closed cover if all its members are closed subsets. A subcover of $\mathcal{C}$ is a subset of $\mathcal{C}$ that still covers $X$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Compact set' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A subset $C\subseteq X$ is called compact if any open cover of $C$ has a finite subcover. That is, if $\mathcal{A}\in\mathcal{T}$ covers $C$, i.e. with $C\subseteq\bigcap\mathcal{A}$, there exists a finite $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{A}$ with $C\subseteq\mathcal{B}$. Alternatively, any infinite collection of open sets that together cover a compact set, always overcovers it. A topological space $X$ is locally compact if every point $x\in X$ has a compact neighbourhood.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proposition' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $C\subseteq X$ be compact. If $B\subseteq C$ is closed, then $B$ is also compact.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose $\mathcal{A}$ is an open cover of $B$. Since $B$ is closed, then $B^c$ is open, so $\mathcal{A}\cup \Set{B^c}$ is an open cover of $C$. Since $C$ is compact, this last collection has a finite subcover of $C$, which is also a finite subscover of $B$. Hence $B$ is also compact.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Compactness is preserved under finite unions' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $C_i \subseteq X$ be compact for each $i$ in a finite index set $I$. Then $C = \bigcup_{i\in I} C_i$ is compact.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose $\mathcal{A}$ is an open cover of $C$. Trivially, $\mathcal{A}$ is also an open cover of $C_i$ for each $i\in I$. Hence there exists a finite subcover $\mathcal{A}_i \subseteq\mathcal{A}$ of $C_i$ for each $i\in I$. Then $\bigcup_{i\in I} \mathcal{A}_i$ is also a finite cover of $C$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Compactness properties of Hausdorff spaces' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a Hausdorff space, then the following properties hold
1. if $C\subseteq X$ is compact, then $C$ is closed, ie. $C^c = X \setminus C \in \mathcal{T}$
2. if $x\in X$, $C\subseteq X$ is compact, and $x\notin C$, then there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ with $x\in U$ and $C\subseteq V$
3. if $x\in X$ and $A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ with $\partial A$ compact, then there exists a closed neighbourhood $B$ of $x$ with $B\subseteq A$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** We will show that $C^c = X\setminus C$ is open, so fix $x\in C^c$. Since $C$ is Hausdorff, each $y\in C$ can be separated from $x$, meaning there are disjoint open sets $U_y, V_y\in\mathcal{T}$ with $x\in U_y$ and $y\in V_y$. Trivially, the collection $\Set{ V_y | y\in C}$ form an open cover of $C$

$$
  C \subseteq \bigcup_{y \in C} V_y
$$

Since $C$ is compact, it has a finite subscover and hence there is a finite subset $B\subseteq C$ such that $\Set{ V_y | y\in B }$ covers $C$. But then $U = \bigcap_{y\in B} U_y$ is open (since $B$ is finite) and disjoint from $\bigcup_{y\in B} V_y$. Thus, $U$ is also disjoint from $C$. To summarize, $U$ is open and $x\in U\subseteq C^c$

**(2):** For each $y\in C$ there exist disjoint open sets $U_y$ and $V_y$ with $x\in U_y$ and $y\in V_y$. Trivially, the collection $\Set{V_y | y\in C}$ is an open cover of $C$, and by compactness there exists a finite subset $B\subseteq C$ such that $\Set{V_y | y\in B}$ covers $C$. Thus, let $U = \bigcap_{y\in B} U_y$ and $V = \bigcup_{y\in B} V_y$. Then $U$ is open, since $B$ is finite, and $V$ is open. Moreover $U$ and $V$ are disjoint, and $x\in U$ and $C\subseteq V$.

**(3):** By property $(2)$, there exists disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ with $x\in U$ and $\partial A\subseteq V$. Hence $\overline{U}$ and $\partial A$ are disjoint. Let $B = \overline{A\cap U}$. Note that $B$ is closed, and is a neighbourhood of $x$ since $U$ and $A$ are neighbourhoods of $x$. Moreover

$$
\begin{align*}
  B &\subseteq \overline{A}\cap\overline{U} \\
  &= [A\cup \partial A]\cap\overline{U} \\
  &= [A\cap\overline{U}] \cup \underbrace{[\partial A \cap\overline{U}]}_{=\emptyset} \\
  &= A\cap\overline{U} \subseteq A
\end{align*}
$$
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Compactness properties of Hausdorff spaces' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. If $x\in X$ and $A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, then there exists a compact neighbourhood $B$ of $x$ with $B\subseteq A$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Since $X$ is locally compact, there exists a compact neighbourhood $C$ of $x$. Hence $A\cap C$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Moreover, $\partial(A\cap C)\subseteq C$ is closed and hence compact. We know that there exists a closed neighbourhood $B$ of $x$ with $B\subseteq A\cap C$. Since $B$ is closed and $B\subseteq C$, it is also compact. Additionally we have $B\subseteq A$.  
</details>
</MathBox>

## Connectivity

<MathBox title='Connected and disconnected spaces' boxType='definition'>
A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is disconnected if there exists two disjoint nonempty open subsets $A, B \subseteq X$ such that $X = A \cup B$ and $\overline{A}\cap B = A \cap \overline{B} = \emptyset$. Otherwise $X$ is connected, which is equivalently true if and only if the only subsets of $X$ that are both open and closed are $\emptyset$ and $X$ itself.
</MathBox>

A connected subset of $X$ is a subset that is connected space when endowed with the subspace topology. A maximal connected subset of $X$ (that is not containing in any larger connected subset) is called a (connected) component of $X$. 

<MathBox title='Path-connected spaces' boxType='definition'>
A path in $X$ from $p \in X$ to $q \in X$ is a continuous map $f: I = [0, 1] \to X$ such that $f(0) = p$ and $f(1) = q$. If there exists a path in $X$ for every pair $p, q \in X$, then $X$ is path-connected. The path components of $X$ are its maximal path-connected subsets.

The topological space $X$ is locally path-connected if $X$ has a basis of path-connected open subsets.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of (path-)connected spaces' boxType='definition'>
Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces.
1. If $F:X \to Y$ is continuous and $X$ is connected, then $F(X)$ is also connected.
2. Every connected subset of $X$ is contained in a single component of $X$.
3. A union of connected subspaces of $X$ with a point in common is connected.
4. The components of $X$ are disjoint nonempty closed subsets whose union is $X$, and thus they form a partition of $X$.
5. If $S \subseteq X$ is both open and closed, then $S$ is a union of components of $X$.
6. Every finite product of connected spaces is connected.
7. Every quotient space of a connected space is connected.
</MathBox>

A topological space is locally path-connected if it admits a basis of path-connected open subsets.

<MathBox title='Properties of locally path-connected spaces' boxType='definition'>
Let $X$ be a topological space.
1. The components of $X$ are open in $X$.
2. The path components of $X$ are equal to its components.
3. $X$ is connected if and only if it is path-connected.
4. Every open subset of $X$ is locally path-connected.
</MathBox>

## Countability axioms

<MathBox title='Dense set' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space. A set $D\subseteq X$ is dense if $U\subseteq D$ is nonempty for every nonempty $U\subseteq\mathcal{T}$. Equivalently, $D$ is dense if every neighbourhood of a point $x\in X$ contains an element of $D$. A set $S$ is said to be nowhere dense in $X$ if $\overline{S}$ contains no nonempty open subset.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proposition' boxType='proposition'>
Suppose $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space. A set $D\subseteq X$ is dense if and only if $\overline{D} = X$
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose $D$ is dense. Since $\overline{D}$ is closed, then $\overline{D}^c$ is open. If this set is nonempty, it must contain a point in $D$. This is a constradiction since $D\subseteq\overline{D}$. Conversely, suppose $\overline{D} = X$, and suppose $U$ is a nonempty open set. Then $U^c$ is closed and $U^c \neq X$. If $D\cap U = \emptyset$, then $D\subseteq U^c$. But then $\overline{D}\subseteq U^c$ so $\overline{D}\neq X$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Countability axioms' boxType='axiom'>
A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is called
1. *separable* if there exists a countable dense subset
2. *first-countable* if each point $x\in X$ has a countable neighbourhood basis
3. *second-countable* if the topology $\mathcal{T}$ has a countable base
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Countability relations' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X,\mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, then the following properties hold
1. if $X$ is second countable, then it is separable
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Suppose $\mathcal{B} = \Set{U_i}_{i\in I}$ is a base for $\mathcal{T}$, where $I$ is a countable index set. Select $x_i\in U_i$ for each $i\in I$, and let $D = \Set{ x_i }_{i\in I}$, which is clearly countable. If $U$ is open and nonempty, then $U = \bigcup_{j\in J} U_j$ for some $J\subseteq I$. But then $\Set{x_j }_{j\in J} \subseteq U$, so $D$ is dense.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $X$ be a second-countable topological space. Every open cover of $X$ has a countable subcover.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a countable basis for $X$, and let $\mathcal{U}$ be an arbitrary open cover of $X$. Let $\mathcal{B}' \subseteq\mathcal{B}$ be the collection of basis open subsets $B\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $B\subseteq U$ for some $U\in\mathcal{U}$. For each $B\in\mathcal{B}'$, choose a particular set $U_B \in\mathcal{U}$ containing $B$. The collection $\Set{U_B | B\in\mathcal{B}'}$ is countable, so it suffices to show that it covers $X$. Given a point $B\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B\subseteq V$. This implies, in particular, that $B\in\mathcal{B}'$ and therefore $x\in B\subseteq U_B$.
</details>
</MathBox>

## Convergence

<MathBox title='Convergent sequence' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A sequence $\left( x_n \in X \right)_{n \in \N}$ of points in $X$ is said to converge to a point $x\in X$, if and only if for each neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ there is a $N \in \N$ such that $x_n \in U$ for all $n \geq N$. This convergence is denoted $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} x$.
</MathBox>

Unlike metric spaces, where neighbourhoods can be made arbitrarily small, the limit of a sequence in a topological space is not necessarily unique. This is only the case if points in the space can be separated, meaning that the space is Hausdorff.

<MathBox title='Uniqueness of limits' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a Hausdorff space. If $\left( x_n \in X \right)_{n\in\N}$ is a sequence of points in $X$ with $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} x$ and $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} y$, then $x = y$.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $x\neq y$, there exists disjoint neighbourhoods $A$ and $B$ of $x$ and $y$, respectively. There exist $M, N \in\N$ such that $x_n \in A$ for all $n \geq M$ and $x_n \in B$ for all $n\geq N$. However, if $n \geq\max\Set{M, N}$, then $x_n \in A$ and $x_n \in B$, giving a contradiction.
</details>
</MathBox>

## Continuity

Continuity of functions is one of the most important concepts of topology. The idea is that if two points are close together in the domain, the functional values should be close together in the range. In topology, this is expressed through preservation of openness between the domain and range spaces. A continuous function has the property that the preimage of an open set (in the range space) is also open (in the domain space).

<MathBox title='Open function' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces. A map $f: X \to Y$ is called open if it sends open sets $A \subseteq X$ to open sets $f[A] \subseteq Y$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Continuous function' boxType='definition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces. A function $f: X\to Y$ is continuous if $f^{-1}[U]\in\mathcal{T}_X$ is open for every open $U \in\mathcal{T}_Y$. The function $f$ is locally continuous at a point $x\in X$ if $f^{-1}[B]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ whenever $B$ is a neighbourhood of $f(x)\in Y$. Given a subset $A\subseteq X$, the function $f$ is continuous on $A$ if $f$ is continuous at each $x\in A$.

If $f$ is bijective and $f^{-1}: Y \to X$ is continuous, then $f$ is also open. The continuity of $f^{-1}$ implies that for all open sets $A \subseteq X$, then $\left( f^{-1} \right)^{-1}[A] = f[A] \subseteq Y$ is also open.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proposition' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be two topoligical spaces. A function $f: X\to Y$ is continuous if and only if $f$ is continuous at each $x\in X$.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose $f$ is continuous. Let $x\in X$ and let $B$ be a neighbourhood of $f(x)$. Then there exists an open set $V\subseteq T$ with $f(x)\in V\subseteq B$. However, then $f^{-1}[V]\in\mathcal{T}_X$ is open in $X$, and $x\in f^{-1}[V]\subseteq f^{-1}[B]$, so $f^{-1}[B]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Hence $f$ is continuous at $x$.

Conversely, suppose $f$ is continuous at each $x\in X$, and suppose $V\in\mathcal{T}_Y$. If $V$ contains no points in the range of $f$, then $f^{-1}[V] = \emptyset\in\mathcal{T}_X$. Otherwise, there exists $x\in X$ with $f(x)\in V$. However, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of $f(x)$, so $U = f^{-1}[V]$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Let $y\in U$. Then $f(y)\in V$ also, so $U$ is also a neighbourhood of $y$, hence $U\in\mathcal{T}$.

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$, $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ and $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$ be three topoligical spaces. If $f: X\to Y$ and $g: Y\to Z$ are continuous, then $g\circ f: X\to Z$ is continuous.

<MathBox title='Continuity is local' boxType='lemma'>
Continuity is a local property in the following sense: if $F:X\to Y$ is a map between topological spaces such that every point $p\in X$ has a neighbourhood $U$ on which the restriction $F|_U$ is continuous, then $F$ is continuous.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Gluing lemma for continuous maps' boxType='lemma'>
Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, and suppose one of the following conditions holds:
1. $B_1,\dots,B_n$ are finitely many closed subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$
2. $\Set{B_i}_{i\in A}$ is a collection of open subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$

Suppose for all $i$ we are given continuous maps $F_i:B_i\to Y$ that agree on overlaps, i.e. $F_i|_{B_i \cap B_j} = F_j|_{B_i \cap B_j}$. Then there exists a unique continuous map $F:X\to Y$ whose restriction to each $B_i$ is equal to $F_i$.

### Homeomorphism

<MathBox title='Homeomorphism' boxType='definition'>
Given two topological spaces $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$, a continuous bijection $f: X \mapsto Y$ with a continuous inverse is called a homeomorphism. When such a function exists, the topoligical spaces $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic. A continuous map is called a local homeomorphism if every point $p \in X$ has a neighbourhood $U \subseteq X$ such that $f(U)$ is open in $Y$ and $f$ restricts to a homeomorphism from $U$ to $f(U)$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of homeomorphisms' boxType='proposition'>
For topological spaces $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$, $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ and $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$, then
1. $X$ is homeomorphic to $X$ (reflexivity)
2. if $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$, then $Y$ is homeomorphic to $X$ (symmetry)
3. if $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$, and $Y$ is homeomorphic to $Z$, then $X$ is homeomorphic to $Z$ (transitivity)
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

1. The identity function $\operatorname{id}: X\to X$ defined by $\operatorname{id}(x) = x$ for $x\in S$ is a homeomorphism from $S$ to itself.
2. If $f: X\to Y$ is a homeomorphism from $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ to $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$, then $f$ is continuous bijection and hence $f^{-1}: Y\to X$ is a homeomorphism from $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ to $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$.
3. If $f: X\to Y$ is a homeomorphism from $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ to $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$, and $g: Y\to Z$ is homeomorphism from $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ to $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$, then $g\circ f: X\to Z$ is homemorphism from $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ to $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$.

### Sequential continuity

A map $f: X \mapsto Y$ is called sequential continuous if for all $x \in X$ such that $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \N}$ with $x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} x$, then $\left( f(x_n) \right)_{n \in \mathcal{N}} \subseteq Y$ is convergent with $f(x_n) \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} f(x)$.

## Subspace

A subspace of the topological space $(X, \mathcal{U})$ is a subset $A \subseteq X$ with the topology given by $\Set{ A \cap U | U \in \mathcal{U} }$

## Product topology

<MathBox title='Product topology' boxType='definition'>
Let $\Set{ \left(X_i, \mathcal{T}_{i}\right) }_{i\in I}$ be a collection of topological spaces, where $I$ is an index set. The product space denoted $\prod_{i\in I} (X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)$ consists of the product space $\prod_{i\in I} X_i$ with a topology given by the basis

$$
  \mathcal{B} := \Set{ \prod_{i\in I} U_i | U_i \in\mathcal{T}_i \textrm{ and }U_i = X_i \textrm{ for all but a finite number of }i\in I }
$$
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Trivially, $\prod_{i\in I} X_i = \bigcup\mathcal{B}$. Given $\prod_{i\in I} A_i \in\mathcal{B}$, $\prod_{i\in I} B_i \in\mathcal{B}$, then 

$$
  \left($\prod_{i\in I} A_i \in\mathcal{B}$\right) \cap \left( $\prod_{i\in I} B_i \in\mathcal{B}$ \right) = \prod_{i, j \in I} A_i \cap B_j \in\mathcal{B}
$$

Hence, $\mathcal{B}$ is a well defined base for the product topology.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Projections are continuous' boxType='proposition'>
Let $\prod_{i\in I} (X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)$ be a product space. The projections $p_j : \prod_{i\in I} (X_i,\mathcal{T}_i)\to X_j$ defined by $p_j (x) = x_j$ are continuous functions.
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $U$ is open in $X_j$, then $p_j^{-1}[U] = \prod_{i\in I} A_i$ where $A_i = X_i$ for $i\in I$ with $i\neq j$ and $A_j = U$, so this preimage is open in the product space.
</details>
</MathBox>

## Quotient space

An equivalence on the set $X$ is a subset $E$ of the set $X \times X = \Set{ \left( x_1, x_2 \right) | x_1, x_2 \in X }$ satisfying
1. reflexivity: $\left( x, x \right) \in E \, \forall x \in E$ or $x \sim x$
2. symmetry: $\left( x, y \right) \in E \Rightarrow \left( y, x \right)$ or $x \sim y \implies y \sim x$
3. transivity: If $\left( x, y \right) \in E$ and $\left( y, z \right) \in E$ then $\left( x, z \right) \in E$, or $x \sim y \wedge y \sim x \implies x \sim z$

If $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $X$, then for each $x \in X$, the equivalence class of $x$ is defined as the subset 

$$
  [x]_\sim := \Set{ y \in X | x \sim y }
$$

The set of all equivalence classes, denoted $X/{\sim}$, is a called a *quotient* of $X$. The quotient $X/{\sim}$ is a partition of $X$ into a collection of nonempty, mutually disjoint subsets, defined as 

$$
  X/{\sim} := \Set{ [x]_\sim | x \in X }
$$

There is a surjective quotient map $\pi: X\to X/{\sim}$ with $x \mapsto [x]_\sim$ called the *canonical/natural projection*. 

If $X$ is a topological space, we define a topology $\mathcal{T}_\sim$ on $X/{\sim}$ be declaring by declaring a subset $U \subseteq X /{\sim}$ to be open if and only if $\pi^{-1}[U] \subset X$ is open, i.e.

$$
  \pi^{-1} [U] \in \mathcal{T} \iff U \in T_\sim
$$

showing that $\pi$ is also continuous. Furthermore, since

$$
  \pi^{-1}\left[\bigcup_\alpha U_\alpha \right] = \bigcup_\alpha \pi^{-1} [U_\alpha]
$$

and

$$
  \pi^{-1} \left[\bigcap_i U_i \right] = \bigcup_i \pi^{-1} [U_i]
$$

the collection of open sets in $X/{\sim}$ is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections, and is therefore a topology. It is called the *quotient topology* of $X$ by the equivalence relation $\sim$.

### Continuity of a map on a quotient

Let $\sim$ be an equivalence realtion on the topological space $X$ and give $X/{\sim}$ the quotient topology. Suppose a function $f:X\to Y$ from $X$ to another topological space $Y$ is constant on each equivalence class. Then it induces a map $\bar{f}: X/{\sim}\to Y$ by

$$
  \bar{f}([x]) = f(x),\; x\in X
$$

giving the commutative diagram

$$
\begin{CD}
  X @>{f}>> Y \\
  @V{\pi}VV @| \\
  X/{\sim} @>>{\bar{f}}> Y
\end{CD}
$$

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-17'>
The induced map $\bar{f}: X/{\sim} \to Y$ is continuous if and only if $f:X\to Y$ is continuous.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $\bar{f}$ is continuous, then as the composite $\bar{f}\circ p$ of continuous function, $f$ is also continuous.

Conversely, suppose $f$ is continuous. Let $V$ be open in $Y$. Then $f^{-1} (V) = \pi^{-1} (\bar{f}^{-1}(V))$ is open in $X$. By the definition of quotient topology, $\bar{f}^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X/{\sim}$. Since $V$ was arbitrary, $\bar{f}:X\setminus Y$ is continuous.
</details>
</MathBox>

### Identification of a subset to a point

If $U$ is a subset of a topological space $X$, we can define a relation $\sim$ on $X$ by declaring

$$
  x\sim x\,\; \forall x\in X
$$

and

$$
  x\sim y,\; \forall x,y\in U
$$

This is an equivalence relation on $X$. We say that the quotient space $X/{\sim}$ is obtained from $X$ by identifying $U$ to a point.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $I = [0,1]$ be the unit interval and $I/{\sim}$ the quotient space obtained from $U$ by identifying the two points $\Set{0,1}$ to a point. Suppose $\mathbb{S}^1$ is the unit circle in the complex pane. The function $\bar{f}:I\to\mathbb{S}^1 \subset\mathbb{C}$ by $f(x) = e^{i2\pi x}$ induces a function $\bar{f}:I/{\sim}\to\mathbb{S}^1$ since $f(0) = f(1)$.

The function $\bar{f}:I/{\sim}\to\mathbb{S}^1$ is a homeomorphism.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Since $f$ is continuous, $\bar{f}$ is also continuous by proposition $\ref{proposition-17}$. Clearly, $\bar{f}$ is a continuous bijection. As the continuous image of the compact set $I$, the quotient $I/{\sim}$ is compact. Thus, $\bar{f}$ is a continuous bijection from the compact space $I/{\sim}$ to the Hausdorff space $\mathbb{S}^1$. By corollary, $\bar{f}$ is a homeomorphism.
</details>
</MathBox>

### Necessary condition for Hausdorff quotients

The quotient construction does not in general preserve the Hausdorff property or second countability.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $X$ be a topological space with an equivalence relation $\sim$. If the quotient space $X/{\sim}$ is Hausdorff, then the equivalence class $[x]$ of any point $x$ in $X$ is closed in $X$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose $\pi:X\to X/{\sim}$ is the canonical projection and $X/{\sim}$ is Hausdorff. Since every singleton set in a Hausdorff space is closed, then for any $x\in X$, its image $\Set{\pi(x)}$ is closed in $X/{\sim}$. By the continuity of $\pi$, the inverse image $\pi^{-1}[\Set{\pi(x)}] = [x]$ is closed in $X$.
</details>
</MathBox>

### Open equivalence relations

<MathBox title='Open equivalence relation' boxType='definition'>
An equivalence relation $\sim$ on a topological space $X$ is open if the canonical projection $\pi:X\to X/{\sim}$ is open.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Graph of an equivalence relation' boxType='definition'>
Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $X$. The graph of $\sim$ is the subset of $X\times X$ that defines the relation

$$
  R = \Set{(x,y)\in X\times X | x\sim y}
$$

If the equivalence relation $\sim$ is equality, then the quotient space $X/{\sim}$ is $X$ itself and the graph $R$ of $\sim$ is simpy the diagonal

$$
  \Delta = \Set{(x,x)\in X\times X}
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose $\sim$ is an open equivalence relation on a topological space $X$. Then the quotient space $X/{\sim}$ is Hausdorff if and only if the graph $R$ of $\sim$ is closed in $X\times X$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

There is a sequence of equivalent statements:
- $R$ is closed in $X\times X$
- $\iff (X\times X)\setminus R$ is open in $X\times X$
- $\iff$ for every $(x,y)\in X\times X - R$ there is a basic open set $U\times V$ containing $(x,y)$ such that $(U\times V)\cap R = \emptyset$
- $\iff$ for every pair $x\nsim y$ in $X$, there exist neighbourhoods $U$ of $x$ and $V$ of $y$ in $X$ such that no element of $U$ is equivalent to an element of $V$
- $\iff$ for any two points $[x] \neq [y]$ is $X/{\sim}$, there exist neighbourhoods $U$ of $x$ and $V$ of $y$ in $X$ such that $p(U)\cap p(V) = \emptyset$ in $X/{\sim}$ **(\*)**

It remains to show that the last statement is equivalent to $X/{\sim}$ being Hausdorff. First assume **(\*)**. Since $\sim$ is an open equivalence relation, $\pi(U)$ and $\pi(V)$ are disjoint open sets in $X/{\sim}$ containing $[x]$ and $[y]$ respectively. Thus, $X/{\sim}$ is Hausdorff.

Conversely, suppose $X/{\sim}$ is Hausdorff. Let $[x]\neq [y]$ in $X/{\sim}$. Then there exist disjoint open sets $A$ and $B$ in $X/{\sim}$ such that $[x]\in A$ and $[y]\in B$. By the surjectivity of $\pi$, we have $A = \pi(\pi^{-1} [A])$ and $B = \pi(\pi^{-1}[B])$. Let $U = \pi^{-1}[A]$ and $V = \pi^{-1}[B]$. Then $x\in U$, $y\in V$ and $A = \pi(U)$ and $B = \pi(V)$ are disjoint open sets in $X/{\sim}$.

A topological space $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal $\Delta$ in $X\times X$ is closed.

<MathBox title='' boxType='theorem'>
Let $\sim$ be an open equivalence relation on a topological space $X$ with canonical projection $\pi:X\to X/{\sim}$. If $\mathcal{B} = \Set{B_\alpha}$ is a basis for $X$, then its image $\Set{\pi(B_\alpha)}$ under $\pi$ is a basis for $X/{\sim}$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Since $\pi$ is an open map, $\Set{\pi(B_\alpha)}$ is a collection of open sets in $X/{\sim}$. Let $W$ be an open set in $X/{\sim}$ and $[x]\in W$ with $x\in X$. Then $x\in \pi^{-1}[W]$. Since $\pi^{-1}[W]$ is open, there is a basic open set $B\in\mathcal{B}$ such that

$$
  x\in B\subset \pi^{-1}[W]
$$

Then

$$
  [x] = \pi(x) \in \pi(B) \subset W
$$

which proves that $\Set{\pi(B_\alpha)}$ is a basis for $X/{\sim}$.

If $\sim$ is an open equivalence relation on a second-countable space $X$, then the quotient space $X/{\sim}$ is second countable.

### Projective space

The *real projective space* $P_n (\R)$ is the quotient space of $\R^{n+1} \setminus\Set{0}$ defined by the equivalence relation

$$
  \mathbf{x}\sim\mathbf{y} :\iff \mathbf{y} = t\mathbf{x},\; \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in\R^{n+1} \setminus\Set{0},\,t\in\R\setminus\Set{0}
$$

We denote the equivalence class of a point $\mathbf{x} = (x^i)_{i=0}^n \in\R^{n+1} \setminus\Set{0}$ by $[\mathbf{x}] = [x^i]_{i=0}^n$, called *homogenous coordinates* on $P_n (\R)$.

Geometrically, two nonzero points in $\R^{n+1}$ are equivalent if and only if they lie on the same line through the origin. Thus, $P_n (\R)$ can be interpreted as the set of all lines through the origin in $\R^{n+1}$. Each line through the origin in $\R^{n+1}$ meets the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^n = \Set{\mathbf{x}\in\R^{n+1} | \lVert\mathbf{x}\rVert = 1}$ in a pair of antipodal points. Conversely, a pair of antipodal points on $\mathbb{S}^n$ determines a unique line through the origin. This gives an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\mathbb{S}^n$ by identifying antipodal points

$$
  \mathbf{x}\sim\mathbf{y} :\iff \mathbf{x} = \pm \mathbf{y},\; \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in\mathbb{S}^n
$$

forming a bijection $P_n (\R) \leftrightarrow \mathbb{S}^{n+1} /{\sim}$.

<MathBox title='Real projective space as a quotient of a sphere' boxType='proposition'>
For $\mathbf{x} = (x^i)_{i=1}^n \in\R^n$, let $\lVert \mathbf{x} \rVert = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x^i)^2}$ be the norm of $\mathbf{x}$. The map $f: \R^{n+1}\setminus\Set{0} \to\mathbb{S}^n$ given by

$$
  f(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\mathbf{x}}{\lVert\mathbf{x}\rVert}
$$

induces a homeomorphism $f: P_n (\R)\to\mathbb{S}^n /{\sim}$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Define $\bar{f}: P_n (\R^n) \to\mathbb{S}^n /{\sim}$ by $\bar{f}([\mathbf{x}]) = \left[\frac{\mathbf{x}}{\lVert \mathbf{x} \rVert}\right] \in \mathbb{S}^n /{\sim}$. This map is well defined because

$$
  \bar{f}([t\mathbf{x}]) = \left[\frac{t\mathbf{x}}{\lVert t\mathbf{x}\rVert}\right] = \left[\pm\frac{\mathbf{x}}{\lVert\mathbf{x}\rVert} \right] = \left[\frac{\mathbf{x}}{\lVert\mathbf{x}\rVert} \right]
$$

Note that if $\pi_1 : \R^{n+1} \setminus\Set{0} \to P_n (\R)$ and $\pi_2 : \mathbb{S}^n \to \mathbb{S}^n /{\sim}$ are the projection maps, then there is a commutative diagram

$$
\begin{align*}
  \R^n \setminus\Set{0} @>{f}>> \mathbb{S}^n \\
  @V{\pi_1}VV @VV{\pi_2}V \\
  P_n (\R) @>>{\bar{f}}> \mathbb{S}^n /{\sim}
\end{align*}
$$

By proposition $\ref{proposition-17}$, $\bar{f}$ is continuous because $\pi_2 \circ f$ is continuous.

Next define $g:\mathbb{S}^n \to\R^{n+1}\setminus\Set{0}$ by $g(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}$. This map induces a map $\bar{g}: \mathbb{S}^n /{\sim} \to P_n (\R)$ by $\bar{g}([\mathbf{x}]) = [\mathbf{x}]$. By the same argument as above, $\bar{g}$ is well defined and continuous. Moreover

$$
  \bar{g}\circ\bar{f}([\mathbf{x}]) = \left[\frac{\mathbf{x}}{\lVert\mathbf{x}\rVert}] = [\mathbf{x}]
$$

and

$$
  \bar{f}\circ\bar{g} ([\mathbf{x}]) = [\mathbf{x}]
$$

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-21'>
The equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\R^{n+1}\setminus\Set{0}$ defining $P_n (\R)$ is open.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

For an open set $U\subset\R^{n+1}\setminus\Set{0}$, the image $\pi(U)$ is open in $P_n (\R)$ if and only if $\pi^{-1}[\pi(U)]$ is open in $\R^{n+1} \setminus\Set{0}$. However, $\pi^{-1}[\pi(U)]$ consists of all nonzero scalar multiples of points of $U$, i.e.

$$
  \pi^{-1} [\pi(U)] = \bigcup_{t\in\R^\times} tU = \bigcup_{t\in\R^\times} \Set{t\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{x}\in U}
$$

Since multiplication by $t\in\R^\times = \R\setminus\Set{0}$ is a homeomorphism of $\R^{n+1} \setminus\Set{0}$, the set $tU$ is open for any $t$. Thus, their union $\bigcup_{t\in\R^\times} tU = \pi^{-1}[\pi(U)]$ is also open.

The real projective space $P_n (\R)$ is second countable.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
The real projective space $P_n (\R)$ is Hausdorff.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Consider $[\mathbf{x}]_\sim , [\mathbf{y}]_\sim \in P_n (\R)$ with $[\mathbf{x}]_\sim \neq [\mathbf{y}]_\sim$. We then take the open neighbourhoods $U, V \in \mathbb{S}^n$ of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ respectively with

$$
\begin{aligned}
  U \cap V &= \emptyset \\
  -U \cap -V &= \emptyset 
\end{aligned}\quad
\begin{aligned}
  -U \cap V &= \emptyset \\
  U \cap -V &= \emptyset 
\end{aligned}
$$

Considering $\hat{U}:= \pi[u]$ where $\pi: \mathbb{S}^n \to \mathbb{S}^n /{\sim}$ is the canonical projection. Taking the preimage we see that 

$$
  \pi^{-1}\left[\hat{U}\right] = U \cup -U \in \mathcal{T} \implies \hat{U} \in \mathcal{T}_\sim
$$

hence, $\hat{U}$ is open. In the same manner it can be shown that $\hat{V}:= \pi[v] \in \mathcal{T}_\sim$ is open. We can now show that

$$
  \pi^{-1}\left[ \hat{U} \cap \hat{V} \right] = \pi^{-1}\left[\hat{U}\right] \cap \pi^{-1}\left[\hat{V}\right] = (U \cup -U) \cap (V \cup -V) = \emptyset
$$

since $\pi$ is surjective we conclude that $\hat{U} \cap \hat{V} = \emptyset$ which proves that $P_n (\R)$ is a Hausdorff space.

## Covering maps

<MathBox title='Covering map' boxType='definition'>
Suppose $E$ and $X$ are topological spaces. A map $\pi:E\to X$ is called a *covering map* if $E$ and $X$ are connected and locally path-connevted, $\pi$ is surjective and continuous, and each point $\mathbf{p}\in X$ has a neighbourhood $U$ that is *evenly covered* by $\pi$, meaning that each component of $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is mapped homemorphically onto $U$ by $\pi$. In this case, $X$ is called the *base of covering*, and $E$ is called a *covering space* of $X$. If $U$ is an evenly covered subset of $X$, the components of $\pi^{-1}(U)$ are called the *sheets of the covering* over $U$. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Lift' boxType='definition'>
If $\pi:E \to X$ is a covering map and $F:B\to X$ is a continuous map, a *lift* of $F$ is a continuous map $\tilde{F}:B\to E$ such that $\pi\circ\tilde{F} = F$

2. **(Path lifting property):** If $f:I\to X$ is a path, then for any point $e\in E$ such that $\pi(\mathbf{e}) = f(0)$, there exists a unique lift $\tilde{f}_\mathbf{e}: I\to E$ of $f$ such that $\tilde{f}(0) = \mathbf{e}$.
3. **(Monodromy theorem):** If $f,g: I\to X$ are path-homotopic paths and $\tilde{f}_\mathbf{e}, \tilde{g}_e: I\to E$ are their lifts starting at the same point $\mathbf{e}\in E$, then $\tilde{f}_\mathbf{e}$ and $\tilde{g}_\mathbf{e}$ are path-homotopic and $\tilde{f}_\mathbf{e}(1) = \tilde{g}_\mathbf{e}(1)$.

Let $\mathbf{y}\in Y$ and $\mathbf{e}\in E$ be such that $\pi(\mathbf{e}) = F(\mathbf{y})$. Then there exists a lift $\tilde{F}: Y\to E$ of $F$ satisfying $\tilde{F}(\mathbf{y}) = \mathbf{e}$ if and only if $F_*(\pi_1(Y,\mathbf{y})) \subseteq \pi_* (\pi_1(E,\mathbf{e}))$.

<MathBox title='Coverings of simply connected spaces' boxType='proposition'>
If $X$ is a simply connected space, then every covering map $\pi:E\to X$ is a homemorphism. A topological space is called *locally simply connected* if it admits a basis of simply connected open subsets.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proposition of a universal covering space' boxType='proposition'>
If $X$ is a connected and locally simply connected topologica space, there exists a simply connected topological space $\tilde{X}$ and a covering map $\pi:\tilde{X}\to X$. If $\hat{\pi}:\hat{X}\to X$ is any other simply connected covering of $X$, there is a homeomorphism $\varphi:\tilde{X}\to\hat{X}$ such that $\hat{\pi}\circ\varphi = \pi$. In this case $\tilde{X}$ is called the *universal covering space* of $X$.

## Locally compact Hausdorff spaces

<MathBox title='Local compactness' boxType='definition'>
A topological space $X$ is *locally compact* if every point has a neighbourhood contained in a compact subset of $X$. A subset of $X$ is *precompact* in $X$ if its closure in $X$ is compact.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Proper maps are closed' boxType='theorem'>
Suppose $X$ is a topological space and that $Y$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space. Then every proper continuous map $F:X\to Y$ is closed.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $K\subseteq X$ be a closed subset. To show that $F(K)$ is closed in $Y$, we show that it contains all of its limit points. Let $\mathbf{y}$ be a limit point of $F(K)$ and let $U$ a precompact neighbourhood of $\mathbf{y}$. Then $\mathbf{y}$ is also a limit point of $F(K) \cap \overline{U}$. Bacause $F$ is proper, $F^{-1}(\overline{U})$ is compact, which implies that $K \cap F^{-1}(\overline{U})$ is compact. Because $F$ is continuous, $F(K \cap F^{-1}(\overline{U})) = F(K) \cap \overline{U}$ is compact and therefore closed in $Y$. In particular, $\mathbf{y}\in F(K) \cap \overline{U} \subseteq F(K)$, so $F(K)$ is closed.

<MathBox title='Baire cateogory theorem' boxType='theorem'>
In a locally compact Hausdorff space or a complete metric space, every countable union of nowhere dense sets has empty interior.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='corollary'>
In a locally compact Hausdorff space or a complete metric space, every nonempty countable closed subset contains at least one isolated point.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Assume $X$ is such a space. Let $A\subseteq X$ be nonempty countable closed subset, and assume $A$ has no isolated points. The fact that $A$ is closed in $X$ means that $A$ itself is either a locally compact Hausdorff space or a complete metric space. For each $\mathbf{a}\in A$, the singleton $\Set{\mathbf{a}}$ is nowhere dense in $A$: it is closed in $A$ because $A$ is Hausdorff, and it contains no nonempty open subsets because $A$ has no isolated points. Since $A$ is a countable union of singletons, the Baire category theorem implies that $A$ has empty interior in $A$, which is a contradiction.

<MathBox title='' boxType='corollary'>
A second-countable, locally compact Hausdorff space admits an exhaustion by compact sets.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Assume $X$ is such a space. Because $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space, it has a basis of precompact open subsets, since it is second-countable, it is covered by countably many such sets. Let $(U_i)_{i=1}^\infty$ be such a countable cover. Beginning with $K_1 = \overline{U}_1$, assume by induction that we have constructed compact sets $K_1,\dots,K_k$ satisfying $U_j \subseteq K_j$ for each $j$ and $K_{j-1}\subseteq \mathrm{int}(K_j)$ for $j \geq 2$. Because $K_k$ is compact, there is some $m_k$ such that $K_k \subseteq U_1 \cup\cdots\cup U_{m_k}$. If we let $K_{k+1} = \overline{U}_1 \cup\cdots\cup \overline{U}_{m_k}$, then $K_{k+1}$ is a compact set whose interior contains $K_k$. By inncreasing $m_k$ if necessary, we may assume $m_k \geq k+1$, so that $U_{k+1} \subseteq K_{k+1}$. By induction, we obtain the required exhaustion.

## Metrizable spaces

<MathBox title='Projections are continuous' boxType='proposition'>
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. If there exists a metric $d$ on $X$ such that $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_d$, i.e. the topology induced by $d$, then $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called metrizable.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Equivalence of metrics' boxType='definition'>
Let $X$ be a set. Metrics $d$ and $e$ on $X$ are equivalent, denoted $d\equiv e$ if $\mathcal{T}_d = \mathcal{T}_e$. The relation $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation on the collection of metrics on $X$ satisfying (for metrics $d,e,f$ on $X$):
1. reflexivity: $d\equiv d$
2. symmetry: $d\equiv e \implies e\equiv d$
3. transitivity: $d\equiv e \land e\equiv f \implies d\equiv f$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Partial order of metrics' boxType='proposition'>
Let $X$ be a set with metrics $d$ and $e$. Then $\mathcal{T}_e$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}_d$, i.e. $\mathcal{T}_d \subseteq \mathcal{T}_e$, if and only if every open ball relative to $d$ contains an open ball relative to $e$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose $\mathcal{T}_d \subseteq \mathcal{T}_e$, i.e. $\mathcal{T}_e$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}_d$. For each $x\in X$ and $a > 0$, the open ball $B_d(x, a)$ at $x$ is in $\mathcal{T}_d$ and hence also in $\mathcal{T}_e$. Thus, there exists $b > 0$ such that $B_e(x, b)\subseteq B_d(x, a)$. Conversely, suppose every open ball relative to $d$ contains an open ball relative to $e$. Consider an arbitrary open set $U\in\mathcal{T}_d$. For each $x\in U$, there is $a > 0$ such that $B_d(x, a)\subseteq U$. Thus, there is $b > 0$ such that $B_e(x, b)\subseteq B_d(x, e)\subseteq U$. Hence $U\in\mathcal{T}_e$ showing that $\mathcal{T}_d\subseteq\mathcal{T}_e$

<MathBox title='Urysohn metrization theorem' boxType='theorem'>
A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is metrizable if it is a regular, second-countable, Hausdorff space.
</MathBox>

## Homotopy

<MathBox title='Homotopy' boxType='definition'>
If $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces and $F_0,F_1:X\to Y$ are continuous maps, a *homotopy* from $F_0$ to $F_1$ is a continuous map $H:X\times I\subseteq \R \to Y$ satisfying for all $x\in X$

$$
\begin{align*}
  H(x,0) =& F_0(x) \\
  H(x,1) =& F_1(x)
\end{align*}
$$

If there exists a homotopy from $F_0$ to $F_1$, we say that $F_0$ and $F_1$ are *homotopic*, denoted $F_0 \simeq F_1$. If the homotopy satisfies $H(x,t) = F_0(x) = F_1(x)$ for all $t\in I$ and all $x$ in some subset $X\subseteq A$, the maps $F_0$ and $F_1$ are said to be homotopic relative to $A$. Both "homotopic" and "homotopic relative to $A$" are equivalence relations on the set of all continuous maps from $X$ to $Y$.
