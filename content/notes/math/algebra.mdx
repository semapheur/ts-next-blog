# Algebraic structures

<MathBox title='Monoid' boxType='definition'>
A monoid is a non-empty set $M$ with a binary (closed) operation, $*: M \times M \to M$ with the properties
- $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c) \in M, $ (associativity)
- $(R, \cdot)$ is a monoid
- Multiplication is distributive related to addition,
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Group' boxType='definition'>
A group is a non-empty set $G$ and a binary operation $*: G \times G \to G$, written $(G, *)$, with the properties
- $a, b\in G \implies a * b \in G$ (closure)
- $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c) \in G, \; \forall a,b,c\in\mathbb{G}$ (associativity)
- $\exists e\in G : a * e = e * a = a \; \forall a\in G$ (identity element)
- $\forall a\in G,\; \exists b\in G : a * b = e$ (inverse element)

Note that the closure property follows implicitly from the definition $*: G \times G \to G$.

A group $(G, *)$ is abelian if $a * b = b * a$ for all $a,b \in G$ (commutativity).

<MathBox title='Ring' boxType='definition'>
A ring is a non-empty set $R$ together with two binary (closed) operations, $+: R \times R \to R$ (addition) and $\cdot: R\times R\to R$, with the properties
- $(R, +)$ is an abelian group
- $(R, \cdot)$ is a monoid
- Multiplication is distributive related to addition,
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Field' boxType='definition'>
A field $\mathbb{F}$ is a set containing $1 \neq 0$ equipped with the binary operations $+$ (addition) and $\cdot$ (multiplication) such that
- $(\mathcal{F}, +)$ is an abelian group
- $(\mathcal{F}\setminus\{0\}, \cdot)$ is an abelian group
- Multiplication is distributive related to addition, i.e. for all $a,b,c\in\mathbb{F}$
  - $a(b + c) = ab + ac$
  - $(a + b)c = ac + bc$
