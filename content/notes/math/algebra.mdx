<MathBox title='Category' boxType='definition'>
A category $\mathcal{C}$ consists of
- a class $\mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{C})$ of *objects*
- a class $\hom(\mathcal{C})$ of *morphism*
- for each morphism $f\in\hom(\mathbb{C})$, two objects $A,B\in\mathrm{ob}(\mathbb{C})$ called the *source* and *target* of $f$, respectively
- for each $A,B,C\in\mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{C})$ a function $\circ: \hom_\mathcal{C}(B,C)\times\hom_\mathcal{C}(A,B)\to\hom_\mathcal{C}(A,C)$ defined by $(f,g)\mapsto g\circ f$ called *composition*
- for each $A\in\mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{C})$ an element $\mathrm{id}_A\in \hom_\mathcal{C}(A,A)$ called the *identity* on $A$

satisfying
- $(h\circ g)\circ f = h \circ (g \circ f)$ for each $f\in\mathcal{C}(A,B)$, $g\in\mathcal{C}(B,C)$ and $h\in\mathcal{C}(C,D)$ **(associativity)**
- $f\circ \mathrm{id}_A = f = \mathrm{id}_B \circ f$ for each $f\in\mathcal{A}$ **(identity law)**
</MathBox>

The following notation is commonly used
- $A\in\mathcal{C}$ instead of $A\in\mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{C})$
- $\mathcal{C}(A,B)$ instead of $\hom_\mathcal{C}(A,B)$
- $f:A\to B$ or $A \xrightarrow{f} B$ instead of $f\in\hom_\mathcal{C}(A,B)$
- $gf$ instead of $g\circ f$
- $1_A$ instead of $\mathrm{id}_A$

A category $\mathcal{C}$ in which both $\mathrm{ob}(\mathbf{C})$ and $\hom(\mathcal{C})$ are sets is called a *small category*. A category in which each class of morphisms $\hom_\mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is a set is called *locally small*. 

Common categories
- $\mathbf{Set}$: sets and maps
- $\mathbf{Top}$: topological spaces and continuous maps
- $\mathbf{Man}$: topological manifolds and continuous maps
- $\mathbf{Diff}$: smooth manifolds and smooth maps
- $\mathbf{Vec}$: vector spaces and linear maps
- $\mathbf{Bilin}$: bilinear maps and tensor products
- $\mathbf{Grp}$: groups and group homomorphisms
- $\mathbf{Ab}$: abelian groups and group homomorphisms
- $\mathbf{Rng}$: rings and ring homomorphisms
- $\mathbf{CRng}$: commutative rings and ring homomorphisms


<MathBox title='Isomorphism' boxType='definition'>
A map $f:A\to B$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is an isomorphism if there exists a map $g: B\to A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that $gf = 1_A$ and $fg = 1_B$. In this case, we say that $f$ is *invertible* and that $g$ is the *inverse* of $f$, denoted $g = f^{-1}$. If there is an isomorphism from $A$ to $B$, we say that $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic, denoted $A\cong B$.

## Functor
<MathBox title='Functor' boxType='definition'>
Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be categories. A *covariant functor* $F:\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$ consists of
1. a map $\mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{A})\to\mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{B})$ defined by $A\mapsto F(A)$
2. for each $A, A'\in\mathcal{A}$ a map $\hom_\mathcal{A}(A,A')\to\hom_\mathcal{B}(F(A), F(A'))$ defined by $f\mapsto F(f)$

satisfying
- $F(f' \circ f) = F(f')\circ F(f)$ whenever $A\xrightarrow{f} A' \xrightarrow{f'} A''$ in $\mathcal{A}$
- $F(1_A) = 1_{F(A)}$ whenever $A\in\mathcal{A}$

A functor is called *contravariant* if for each $A, A'\in\mathcal{A}$ a there is a map $\hom_\mathcal{A}(A,A')\to\hom_\mathcal{B}(F(A'), F(A))$ by $f\mapsto F(f)$ such that
- $F(f' \circ f) = F(f)\circ F(f')$ whenever $A\xrightarrow{f} A' \xrightarrow{f'} A''$ in $\mathcal{A}$
</MathBox>

If $\mathcal{C}$ is a cateogory whose objects are sets with some additional structure and whose morphisms are maps preserving that structure, the *forgetful functor* $F:C\to\mathbf{Set}$ assigns to each object its underlying set, and to each morphism the same map thought of as a map between sets. 

<MathBox title='' boxType='definition'>
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a locally small category and $A\in\mathcal{A}$. The functor

$$
  H^A = \mathcal{A}(A,\cdot): \mathcal{A}\to\mathbf{Set}
$$

is defined as follows
- $H^A(B) = \mathcal{A}(A,B)$ for $B\in\mathcal{B}$
- for $g\in\mathcal{A}(B, B')$ define
$$
  H^A(g) = \mathcal{A}(A,g): \mathcal{A}(A,B)\to\mathcal{A,B'}
$$

by

$$
  p\mapsto g\circ p
$$

for all $p:A\to B$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Representable' boxType='definition'>
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a locally small category. A functor $X:\mathcal{A}\to\mathbf{Set}$ is *representable* if $X\cong H^A$ for some $A\in\mathcal{A}$. A *representation* of $X$ is a choice of an object $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and an isomorphism between $H^A$ and $X$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Natural transformation' boxType='definition'>
Let $F, G:\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$ be two functors. A *natural transformation* $\alpha:F\to G$ is a collection $\left((F(A) \xrightarrow{\alpha_A} G(A))\right)_{A\in\mathcal{A}}$ of maps in $\mathcal{B}$ such that for every map $f:A\to A'$ in $\mathcal{A}$, the following diagram commutes.

$$
\begin{CD}
  F(A) @>F(f)>> F(A') \\
  @V{\alpha_A}VV @VV{\alpha_{A'}}V \\
  G(A) @>>G(f)> G(A')
\end{CD}
$$

The maps $\alpha_A$ are called the components of $\alpha$.

```
</LatexFig>

If every component $\alpha_A$ is invertible in $\mathcal{B}$, then $\alpha$ is called a *natural isomorphism*, denoted $\alpha: F\cong G$. In this case, the inverses $\alpha_A^{-1}$ in $\mathcal{B}$ are the components of a natural isomorphism $\alpha^{-1}:B\to A$.
</MathBox>

## Universality
<MathBox title='Universal morphism' boxType='definition'>
Let $F:\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$ be a functor between categories $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ and suppose $B\in\mathcal{B}$ is an object in $\mathcal{B}$. A *universal morphism* from $B$ to $F$ is a pair $(A, u: B\to F(A))$ of an object $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and a morphism $u\in\mathcal{D}(B,F(B))$ satisfying the *universal property*:
- for any pair $(A', f)$ with $A'\in\mathcal{A}$ and $f\in\mathcal{B}(B,F(A'))$, there is a unique morphism $h:A\to A'$ in $\mathcal{A}$ such that $f = F(h) \circ u$ according to following diagram.

</LatexFig>

Equivalently, a universal morphism from $F$ to $B$ is a unique pair $(A, u: F(A)\to B)$ of an object $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and a morphism $u\in\mathcal{B}(F(A),B)$ satisfying the universal property:
- for any pair $(A', f)$ with $A'\in\mathcal{A}$ and $f\in\mathcal{B}(F(A'), B)$ there is a unique morphism $h:A' \to A$ in $\mathbb{A}$ such that $f = u\circ F(h)$.

<MathBox title='Monoid' boxType='definition'>
A monoid is a non-empty set $M$ with a binary operation, $*: M \times M \to M$ with the properties
- $a,b\in M \implies a * b \in M$ **(closure)**
- $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c) \in M$ **(associativity)**
- $\exists e\in M : a * e = e * a = a \; \forall a\in M$ **(identity element)**
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Group' boxType='definition'>
A group is a non-empty set $G$ and a binary operation $*: G \times G \to G$, written $(G, *)$, with the properties
- $a, b\in G \implies a * b \in G$ **(closure)**
- $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c) \in G, \; \forall a,b,c\in\mathbb{G}$ **(associativity)**
- $\exists e\in G : a * e = e * a = a \; \forall a\in G$ **(identity element)**
- $\forall a\in G,\; \exists b\in G : a * b = e$ **(inverse element)**

Note that the closure property follows implicitly from the definition $*: G \times G \to G$.

A group $(G, *)$ is abelian if $a * b = b * a$ for all $a,b \in G$ (commutativity). 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Field' boxType='definition'>
A field $\mathbb{F}$ is a set containing $1 \neq 0$ equipped with the binary operations $+$ (addition) and $\cdot$ (multiplication) such that
- $(\mathbb{F}, +)$ is an abelian group
- $(\mathbb{F}\setminus\Set{0}, \cdot)$ is an abelian group
- Addition and multiplication are related by distributivity, i.e. for all $a,b,c\in\mathbb{F}$
    - $a(b + c) = ab + ac$
    - $(a + b)c = ac + bc$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Algebra' boxType='definition'>
An algebra $A$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is a nonempty set $A$, together with three operations
- $+:A\times A\to A$ **(addition)**
- $\cdot: A\times A\to A$ **(multiplication)**
- $\cdot: \mathbb{F}\times A\to A$ **(scalar multiplication)**

for which the following properties hold:
- $A$ is a vector space over $\mathbb{F}$ under addition and scalar multiplication
- $A$ is a ring under addition and multiplication
- if $r\in\mathbb{F}$ and $a,b\in A$ then $r(ab) = (ra)b = a(rb)$ (scalar compatibility)
</MathBox>

# Ring theory

<MathBox title='Ring' boxType='definition'>
A ring is a non-empty set $R$ equipped with two binary (closed) operations, 
- $+: R \times R \ni (a,b)\mapsto a + b \in R$ **(addition)**
- $\cdot: R\times R \ni (a,b)\mapsto ab \in R$ **(multiplication)***

with the properties
- $(R, +)$ is an abelian group
- $(R, \cdot)$ is a monoid
- Addition and multiplication are related by distributity, i.e. for all $a,b,c\in R$
    - $(a + b)c = ac + bc$
    - $c(a + b) = ca + cb$

A ring is commutative if $ab = ba$ for all $a,b\in R$. If a ring $R$ contains an element $e$ such that $ae = ea = a$ for all $a\in R$, we say that $R$ is a ring with identity.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Zero divisors and units' boxType='definition'>
Let $a,b$ be in a ring $R$. If $a \neq 0$ and $b \neq 0$ but $ab = 0$, then $a$ and $b$ are *zero divisiors*. If $ab = ba = 1$, we say the $a$ is a *unit*, or that $a$ is invertible.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Integral domain, division ring (skew field) and field' boxType='definition'>
An *integral domain* is a commutative ring with no zero divisor. A *division ring* or *skew field* is a ring in which every non-zero element $a$ has an inverse $a^{-1}$. A *field* is a commutative ring in which every non-zero element is invertible.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Ring characteristic' boxType='definition'>
The *characteristic* of a ring $R$, denoted $\operatorname{char}(R)$, is the smallest positive integer such that

$$
  n\cdot 1 = \underbrace{1 + \cdots + 1}_{n \text{ times}} = 0
$$

If there is no such positive integer, then $\operatorname{char}(R) = 0$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Subring' boxType='definition'>
A subring of a ring $R$ is a subset $S$ of $R$ forming a ring under the operations of addition and multiplication defined in $R$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Ring homomorphism' boxType='definition'>
Let $R, S$ be two rings. A map $f:R\to S$ is a ring homomorphism if it satisfies for $a,b\in R$
1. $f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)$ (group homomorphism)
2. $f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$
3. $f(1_R) = 1_S$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Ideals' boxType='definition'>
Let $\mathcal{I}$ be a subset of ring $R$. An additive subgroup of $R$ is called
- a *left ideal* of $R$ if $ra\in\mathcal{I}$ for $a\in\mathcal{I}$ and $r\in R$
- a *right ideal* of $R$ if $ar\in\mathcal{I}$ for $a\in\mathcal{I}$ and $r\in R$

A left ideal that is also a right ideal, is called a *(two-sided) ideal* of $R$. An ideal is *proper* if $\mathcal{I} \neq R$, and it is *non-trivial* if in addition $\mathcal{I}\neq 0$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Kernels of ring homomorphisms' boxType='definition'>
If $f:R\to S$ is a ring homomorphism, its kernel is defined as

$$
  \ker(f) = \Set{r\in R | f(r) = 0}
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Kernels of ring homomorphisms are proper ideals' boxType='proposition'>
The kernel of a ring homomorphism $f:R\to S$ is a proper two-sided ideal.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Since a ring homomorphism is a group homomorphism, we already know that $f$ is injective if and only if $\ker(f) = \Set{0}$. Note that $\ker(f)$ is an additive subgroup of $R$. Take $a\in\ker(f)$ and $r\in R$, then 

$$
\begin{align*}
  f(ra) =& f(r)f(a) = 0 \\
  f(ar) =& f(a)f(r) = 0
\end{align*}
$$

showing that $\ker(f)$ is a two-sided ideal since $ra, ar\in\ker(f)$. Moreover, $\ker(f)$ has to be proper, i.e. $\ker(f) \neq R$, since $f(1) = 1$ by definition.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='lemma'>
Suppose $f:R\to S$ is a ring homomorphism and the only two-sided ideals of $R$ are $\Set{0}$ and $R$. Then $f$ is injective.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Since $\ker(f)$ is a two-sided ideal of $R$, then either $\ker(f) = \Set{0}$ or $\ker(f) = R$. However, $\ker(f) \neq R$ since $f(1) = 1$ by defininition.
</details>
</MathBox>

It is worth noting the analogy between rings and their two-sided ideals on one hand, and groups and their normal subgroups on the other hand:
- Two-sided ideals are stable when the ring acts on them by multiplication, either on the right or on the left, and thus
$$
  rar^{-1} \in\mathcal{I}, a\in\mathcal{I}, r\in R
$$
while normal subgroups are stable when the groups on them by conjugation
$$
  ghg^{-1} \in H, h\in H, g\in G (H \leq G)
$$
- Groups with only trivial normal subgroups are called simple. Similarly, rings with only two sided ideals are called simple rings.
- The kernel of a group homomorphism is a normal subgroup, while the kernel of a ring homomorphism is an ideal.

## Quotient rings

Let $\mathcal{I}$ be a proper two-sided ideal of $R$. Since $\mathcal{I}$ is an additive subgroup of $R$ by definition, it makes sense to speak of cosets $r + \mathcal{I}$ of $I$ for $r\in R$. Furthermore, a ring has a structure of abelian group for addition, so $\mathcal{I}$ satisfies the definition of a normal subgroup. From group theory, we that it makes sense to speak of the quotient group

$$
  R\setminus\mathcal{I} = \Set{r + \mathcal{I} | r\in R}
$$

which is abelian since $(R, +)$ is an abelian group. We now endow $R\setminus\mathcal{I}$ with a multiplication operation defined as

$$
  (r + \mathcal{I})(r + \mathcal{I}) = rs + \mathcal{I}
$$

To see that it is well-defined, we check that it does not depend on the choice of the representative in each coset. Suppose

$$
\begin{align*}
  r + \mathcal{I} =& r' + \mathcal{I} \\
  s + \mathcal{I} =& s' + \mathcal{I}
\end{align*}
$$

so that $a = r' - r\in\mathcal{I}$ and $b = s' - s\in\mathcal{I}$. Then

$$
  r's' = (a + r)(b + s) = ab + as + rb + rs
$$

Since $a, b\in\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{I}$ is an ideal, it follows that $ab, as, rb\in\mathcal{I}$. Consequently, $r's' \in rs + \mathcal{I}$ and therefore multiplication does not depend on the choise of representatives.

Note that this is only true if $\mathcal{I}$ is a two-sided ideal, otherwise we could not have concluded that both $as$ and $rb$ are in $\mathcal{I}$.

<MathBox title='Quotient ring' boxType='definition'>
The set of cosets of the two-sided ideal $\mathcal{I}$ given by

$$
  R\setminus\mathcal{I} = \Set{r + \mathcal{I} | r\in R}
$$

is a ring with identity $1_R + \mathcal{I}$ and zero element $0_R + \mathcal{I}$ called a *quotient ring*.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Every proper two-sided ideal $\mathcal{I}$ is the kernel of a ring homomorphism.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Consider the canonical projection $\pi:R\to R\setminus\mathcal{I}$ defined by $r\mapsto\pi(r) = r + \mathcal{I}$. We already know that $\pi$ is a group homomorphism, and that its kernel is $\mathcal{I}$. We are only left to that $\pi$ is a ring homomorphism. Since $\mathcal{I}$ is a two-sided ideal, $R\setminus\mathcal{I}$ is a ring. Moreover, for $r, s\in R$

$$
  \pi(rs) = rs + \mathcal{I} = (r + \mathcal{I})(s + \mathcal{I}) = \pi(r)\pi(s)
$$

Finally, $\pi(1_R) = 1_R + \mathcal{I}$ which is indeed the identity element of $R\setminus\mathcal{I}$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Factor theorem for rings' boxType='theorem'>
Any ring homomorphism $f$ whose kernel $\ker(f)$ contains $\mathcal{I}$ can be factored through $R\setminus\mathcal{I}$. In other words, there is a unique ring homomorphism $\bar{f}:R\setminus\mathcal{I}\to S$ such that $\bar{f}\circ\pi = f$, where $\pi:R\to R\setminus\mathcal{I}$ is the canonical projection. Furthermore,
1. $\bar{f}$ is an epimorphism if and only if $f$ is
2. $\bar{f}$ is a monomorphism if and only if $\ker(f) = \mathcal{I}$
3. $\bar{f}$ is an isomorphism if and only if $f$ is an epimorphism and $\ker(f) = \mathcal{I}$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $a + \mathcal{I}\in R\setminus\mathcal{I}$ such that $\pi(a) = a + \mathcal{I}$ for $a\in R$, and define

$$
  \bar{f}(a + \mathcal{I}) = f(a)
$$

We need check that $\bar{f}$ is well defined in the sense that it should not depend on the choice of the representative taken in the coset. Take another representative, say $b \in a + \mathcal{I}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are in the same coset, they satisfy $a - b \in \mathcal{I} \subset\ker(f)$. Because $a - b \in\ker(f)$, we have $f(a - b) = 0$ and thus $f(a) = f(b)$.

Now that $\bar{f}$ is well defined, it remains to verify that $\bar{f}$ inherits the property of the ring homomorphism from $f$. The rest of the proof works exactly the same as for groups.

</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='First isomorphism theorem for rings' boxType='theorem'>
If $f:R\to S$ is a ring homomorphism with kernel $\ker(f)$, then the range of $f$ is isomorphic to $R\setminus K$:

$$
  \operatorname(f) \cong R\setminus\ker(f) 
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

By the factor theorem $\bar{f}: R\setminus\ker(f)\to S$ is an isomorphism if and only if $f$ is an epimorphism, and clearly $f$ is an epimorphism on its image, which concludes the proof.
