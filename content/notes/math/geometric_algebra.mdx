# Exterior algebras

A permutation of the set of $p$ elements $A = \set{1,\dots,p}$ is a bijection $\sigma: A\to A$ represented by the cycle

$$
\begin{matrix}
  1 & \cdots & p \\
  \sigma(1) & \cdots & \sigma(p)
\end{matrix}
$$

The set of all permutations is group called the symmetric group, denoted $S_p$. The number of elements in $S_p$ is $p!$.

A permutation $\sigma$ of the set $\set{1,\dots,p}$ such that $\sigma(k) = k$ for all $k \neq i$, and $k \neq j$, and moreover $\sigma(i) = j$ and $\sigma(j) = i$, is called a transposition. A permutation of $n$ elements is even or odd if the permutation is obtained respectively by an even or odd number of transpositions. The sign $\varepsilon(\sigma)$ of the permutation $\sigma$ is defined to be $\varepsilon(\sigma) = 1$ if the permutation is even, and $\varepsilon(\sigma) = -1$ if the permutation is odd.

Let us consider a tensor that is either contravariant or covariant of the form $\bigotimes_{i=1}^p X_i$, where $X$ denotes respectively either a vector or a coverctor, and the indices enumerate such elements. The operator $\operatorname{alt}$ called alternator is defined in the following way

$$
  \operatorname{alt}(X_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes X_p) = \frac{1}{p!} \sum_{\sigma\in S_p} \varepsilon(\sigma) X_{\sigma(1)} \otimes\cdots\otimes X_{\sigma(p)}
$$

The alternator is a projection operator, i.e. $\operatorname{alt}^2 = \operatorname{alt}$. Considers covariant tensors of the form $\bigotimes_{i=1}^p \alpha_i$ given by

$$
  (\alpha_1 \otimes\cdots\alpha_p)(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_p) = \alpha_1 (\mathbf{v}_1)\cdots\alpha_p (\mathbf{v}_p)
$$

The alternator of a contravariant tensor is then defined by writing the resulting tensor acting on vectors as

$$
  \operatorname{alt}(\alpha_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes\alpha_p)(\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_p) = \frac{1}{p!}\begin{vmatrix}
    \alpha_1 (\mathbf{v}_1) & \cdots & \alpha_1 (\mathbf{v}_p) \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    \alpha_p (\mathbf{v}_1) & \cdots & \alpha_p (\mathbf{v}_p)
  \end{vmatrix}
$$

Bivector basis
$$
\begin{align*}
  (e_1 e_2)^2 &= e_1 e_2 e_1 e_2 = -e_2 e_1 e_1 e_2 \\ 
  &= -e_2 e_1^2 e_2 = -e_2 e_2 = -e_2^2 \\
  &= -1
\end{align*}
$$

Geometric product
$$
\begin{align*}
  uv &= u\cdot v + u\wedge v \\ 
  &= |u|\cdot|v|\cos(\theta_{uv}) + |u|\cdot|v|\sin(\theta_{uv})I \\
  &= |u|\cdot|v|\left[\cos(\theta_{uv}) + I\sin(\theta_{uv})\right]
  &= |u|\cdot|v|e^{\theta_{uv}I}
\end{align*}
$$

## Rotations

Two reflections is a rotation 
$$
  u'' = (vw)^{-1}u(vw) = \frac{1}{|u|\cdot|v|}e^{-\theta I} u |v|\cdot|w|e^{\theta I} = e^{-\theta I}u e^{\theta I}
$$
