# Group 

<MathBox title='Group' boxType='definition'>
A group $(G, *)$ is a non-empty set $G$ equipped with a binary operation $*: G \times G \to G$ by 

$$
  (g,h) \mapsto g*h =: gh
$$

satisfying the axioms:
- **Closure:** $a, b\in G \implies a * b \in G$
- **Associativity:**
$$
\begin{equation*}
  (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) \in G, \; \forall a,b,c\in\mathbb{G}
\tag{\label{equation-6}}
\end{equation*}
$$

- **Existence of an identity/neutral element:** There exists $e\in G$ such that for every $g\in G$
$$
\begin{equation*}
  g * e = e * g = g, \; \forall g\in G
\tag{\label{equation-7}}
\end{equation*}
$$ 

- **Existence of inverses:** For each $g\in G$ there exists $g^{-1}\in G$ called the inverse of $g$, which has the property
$$
\begin{equation*}
  g * g^{-1} = e
\tag{\label{equation-8}}
\end{equation*}
$$

A group $(G, *)$ is *Abelian* or *commutative* if $*$ also satisfies 
- $a * b = b * a$ for all $a,b \in G$ **(commutativity)** 

Note that the closure property follows implicitly from the fact that $*$ is a binary operation on $G$, and is thus sometimes not listed as a group axiom. The group operation is usually referred to as *(group) multiplication*, in which case the operation of two group elements is called a *product*. The group operation $*$ is also usually denoted by $\circ$ or $\cdot$. To simplify notation, it is common to omit the group operation symbol.

If the group operation is addition, the group is called *additive* and the inverse of $a$ is the negative $-a$. Similarly, if the group operation is multiplication, the group is called *multiplicative* and the inverse of $a$ is denoted $a^{-1}$.

A group $(G, *)$ is *discrete* if its underlying set $G$ is countable. Otherwise if $G$ is uncountable the group is *continuous*. Furthermore, if $G$ is equipped with a smooth manifold structure such that the group operations are smooth maps, then the group is a *Lie group*.

The existence of inverse elements implies that the cancellation laws holds in groups

$$
\begin{align*}
  ab =& ac \implies b = c \\
  ba =& ca \implies b = c
\end{align*}
$$

Conversely, if $G$ is finite, cancellation laws imply the existence of inverse elements. The map $G \ni x\mapsto ax \in G$ is injective, and hence bijective by counting. In particular, $e$ is in the image, and so $a$ has a right inverse. Similarly, it has a left inverse, and by uniqueness the two inverses are equal.

<MathBox title='Uniqueness of group identity and inverses' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-1'>
The unit element $e\in G$ of a group $(G,*)$ is unique, and for any $g\in G$ its inverse $g^{-1}$ is also unique.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**Uniqueness of group identity**

Suppose there is an identity element $\tilde{e} \in G$ such that for every $g \in G$ we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  g\tilde{e} =& g \tag{\label{equation-1}} \\
  gg^{-1} =& \tilde{e} \tag{\label{equation-2}}
\end{align*}
$$

This implies

$$
\begin{align*}
  g^{-1} \tilde{e} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-1}} g^{-1} \implies& gg^{-1} \tilde{e} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-8}} gg^{-1} = e \\
  \implies& e \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-2}} \tilde{e}\tilde{e} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-1}} \tilde{e}
\end{align*}
$$

showing that $e$ is unique.

**Uniqueness of group inverses**

Suppose $h_1$ and $h_2$ are two inverses of $g\in G$, i.e.

$$
\begin{align*}
  gh_1 = e = gh_2
\tag{\label{equation-3}}
\end{align*}
$$

Then it follows for $i\in\set{1,2}$ that

$$
\begin{equation*}
  g \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-7}} ge \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-8}} gh_i h_i^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-3}} = eh_i^{-1}
\tag{\label{equation-4}}
\end{equation*}
$$

and thus

$$
  h_i g \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-4}} = h_i eh^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-7}} h_i h_i^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-8}} e
$$

Consequently, we also have

$$
\begin{equation*}
  h_1 g = e = h_2 g
\tag{\label{equation-5}}
\end{equation*}
$$

which finally implies

$$
\begin{align*}
  h_1 \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-7}}& h_1 e \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-8}} h_1 gg^{1} \\
  \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-5}}& h_2 gg^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-8}} h_2 e \\
  \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-7}}& h_2
\end{align*}
$$

**(1):** From $\eqref{equation-7}$ we have for $g = e$ that $ee = e$ and from $\eqref{equation-8}$ we see that then $e = e^{-1}$.

**(2):** By associativity we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
  ab (b^{-1} a^{-1}) =& abb^{-1} a^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-8}} aea^{-1} \\
  \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-7}}& aa^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-8}} e
\end{align*}
$$

**(3):** Note that $\eqref{equation-8}$ implies $e = g^{-1} (g^{-1})^{-1}$. Multiplying both sides with $g$ and using that, because of $\eqref{equation-7}$, we have on the left side $ge = g$, we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
  g =& gg^{-1} (g^{-1})^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-8}} e(g^{-1})^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-9}} e^{-1} (g^{-1})^{-1} \\
  \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-10}}& (g^{-1} e)^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-7}} (g^{-1})^{-1}

$$

**(4):** We have

$$
\begin{align*}
  h = g \implies& hg^{-1} = gg^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-8}} e \\
  \underbrace{\implies}_{\eqref{equation-8}}& h^{-1} = g^{-1} \tag{\label{equation-13}} \\
  \underbrace{\implies}_{\eqref{equation-13}}& (h^{-1})^{-1} = (g^{-1})^{-1} \underbrace{\implies}_{\eqref{equation-11}} h = g

2. $e * g = g$

and for any $h, k \in G$

3. $g * h = g * k \iff h = k \iff h * g = k * g$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Note that

$$
\begin{equation*}
  (g^{-1} g)^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-10}} g^{-1} (g^{-1})^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-11}} g^{-1} g
\tag{\label{equation-14}}
\end{equation*}
$$

which implies

$$
\begin{align*}
  e \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-8}}& g^{-1} g(g^{-1} g)^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-14}} g^{-1} gg^{-1} g \\
  \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-8}}& g^{-1} eg \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-7}} g^{-1} g
\end{align*}
$$

**(2):** Note that

$$
\begin{align*}
  eg \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-12}}& \left((eg)^{-1}\right)^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-10}} (g^{-1} e^{-1})^{-1} \\
  \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-9}}& (g^{-1} e)^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-7}} (g^{-1})^{-1} \\
  \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-12}}& g
\end{align*}
$$

**(3):** Let $gh = gk$ for some $g,h,k \in G$. Multiplying both sides from the left by $g^{-1}$ and using $\eqref{equation-15}$ implies $h = k$. Multiplying this in turn by $g$ from the left yields $gh = gk$. Hence, $gh = gk$ if and only if $h = k$. The proof of the equivalence of $hg = kg$ with $h = k$ is similar.

<MathBox title='' boxType='lemma'>
Let $N\in\N_+$. Then the set $G = \set{0,\dots,N-1}$ with the group operation given by addition modulo $N$, i.e.

$$
\begin{equation*}
  a +_{\Z_N} b := (a + b): \bmod N
\tag{\label{equation-16}}
\end{equation*}
$$

is a finite Abelian group $(G, +_{\Z_N})$ denoted by $\Z_N$.

Moreover, for a prime $p$ the set $G \setminus\set{0} = \set{1,\dots,p-1}$ with group multiplication is given by

$$
  a \cdot_{\Z_p} b := (ab) \bmod p
$$

also constitutes a finite Abelian group $(G\setminus\set{0}, *\cdot_{\Z_p})$, which is denoted $\Z_p^\times$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

First, consider the additive group $\Z_N$. Since $(a + b) \bmod N \in\set{0,\dots,N-1}$ the group operation given in $\eqref{equation-16}$ is a map $G\times G\to G$ that is associative. The neutral element is $e_+ = 0$ and the inverse of $a\in G\setminus\set{0}$ is given by $a^{-1} = N - a \in G$ since

$$
  a +_{\Z_N} a^{-1} \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-16}} (a + N - a) \bmod N = 0 = e_+
$$

Clearly, $G$ is finite and $a +_{\Z_N} b = b +_{\Z_N}$ a.

Now consider $\Z_p^\times$, where $p$ is a prime, and let $a, b\in\set{1,\dots,p-1}$ such that $a \bmod p \neq 0 \neq b \bmod p$. It follows that $(ab) \bmod p \eq 0$. Consequently. $(ab) \bmod p \in\set{2,\dots,N-1}$, and the group operation in $\eref{equation-17}$ is a map $G\set\minus\set{0} \times G\setminus\set{0} \to G\setminus\set{0}$ that is associative. The neutral element of this group is $e = 1$ since for any $a\in\set{1,\dots,p-1}$ we have $a \cdot_{\Z_p} e = a\bmod p = a$. Moreover, since for any such $a$ we have $\gcd(a,p) = 1$, we know using the extended Euclid algorithm that we can always fin $x, y\in\Z$ such that $ax + py = 1$. It folows that $x\bmod p = a^{-1} \bmod p \in G\setminus\set{0}$ such that

$$
  a \cdot_{\Z_p} (x \bmod p) \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-16}} = (a(x\bmod p)) \bmod p = 1
$$

Hence, every $a \in G\setminus\set{0}$ has an inverse under $\cdot_{\Z_p} in $G\setminus\set{0}$.

Obviously, $a\cdot\Z_p b = (ab) \bmod p = b\cdot_{\Z_p} a$, which completes the proof.

<MathBox title='Group isomorphism' boxType='definition'>
Two groups $(G, *)$ and $(H,\circ)$ are *isomorphic* if there is a bijection $\alpha:H\to G$ such that

$$
  \alpha(a * b) = \alpha(a) \circ\alpha(b),\; \forall a,b\in G
$$

The mapping $\alpha$ is called an *isomorphism* and we say that $G$ is isomorphic to $H$, denoted $G \cong H$. If $\alpha$ is not bijective, it is called a *homomorphism*. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Group order' boxType='definition'>
The *order* $|G|$ of a group $G$ is its cardinality. A finite group whose order is a power of a prime $p$ is called a *p*-group. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Group element order' boxType='definition'>
For an element $a$ of a group $(G, *)$, define
- $a^n = \underbrace{a * \cdots * a}_{n \text{ times}}$
- $a^{-n} = (a^{-1})^n = \underbrace{a^{-1} * \cdots * a^{-1}}_{n \text{ times}}$
- $a^0 = e$

With the exponentiation rules for all $m, n\in\Z$

$$
\begin{align*}
  a^m a^n =& a^{m+n} \\
  (a^m)^n =& a^{mn}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that the set

$$
  \Set{n\in\Z | a^n = e}
$$

is an ideal in $\Z$, and so equals $m\Z$ for $m\in\N$. When $m = 0$, then $a^n \neq e$ unless $n \neq 0$, and $a$ is said to have *infinite order*. When $m \neq 0$, it is the smallest integer $m > 0$ such that $a^m = e$, and $a$ is said to have *finite order* $n$. In this case, $a^{-1} = a^{m-1}$, and

$$
  a^n = e \iff m|n
$$

<MathBox title='Integers under addition form a group' boxType='example'>
The set of integers $\Z = \Set{ n }_{n=-\infty}^\infty$ with standard addition forms an infinite discrete Abelian group, denoted $(\Z, +)$. Addition on $\Z$ is associative and commutative with identity element $e = 0$ and inverse elements $a^{-1} = -a$ for all $a\in\Z$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Congruence classes under addition form a group' boxType='example'>
The set of congruence classes modulo $n\in\N_+$

$$
\begin{gather*}
  \Z_n := \Z / n\Z = \Set{[i]_n}_{i=0}^{n-1} \\
  [a]_n = \Set{b\in\Z | a - b = kn,\; k\in\Z }
\end{gather*}
$$

are finite cyclic groups $\Z_n$ of order $n$, where the binary operation is addition modulo $n$. Since $+$ is associative on $\Z$, we have for $[a]_n, [b]_n, [c]_n \in \Z_n$

$$
  [a]_n + ([b]_n + [c]_n) = [a]_n + [b + c]_n = [a + b + c]_n
$$

and

$$
  ([a]_n + [b]_n) + [c]_n = [a + b]_n + [c]_n = [a + b + c]_n
$$

showing that modular addition is associative. The identity element is $[0]_n$, while inverse elements are of the form $[a]_n^{-1} = [-a]_n$ for all $a\in\Z$.

The simplest non-trivial case is $\Z_2 = \Set{0,1}$ with three possibilities of addition

$$
  0 + 0 = 0,\quad 0 + 1 = 1,\quad 1 + 1 = 0
$$

Defining the bijections $0 \leftrightarrow 1$ and $1 \leftrightarrow -1$, the group $\Z_2$ is isomorphic to the group $G = \Set{-1, 1}$ equipped with standard multiplication and identity element $e = 1$. The latter group $G$ has three possibilities of multiplication

$$
  1\cdot 1 = 1,\quad 1\cdot (-1) = -1,\quad (-1)\cdot(-1) = 1
$$

In general, $\Z_n$ is isomorphic to the group forming the $n$-th roots of unity, $G = \Set{e^{2\pi i k/n} | k=1,\dots,n-1}$, equipped with standard multiplication.

## Subgroups

<MathBox title='Subgroup' boxType='definition'>
Let $(G, *)$ be a group. A nonempty subset $H \subseteq G$ is a *subgroup* of $G$, denoted $H \leq G$, if $H$ forms a group under the binary operation $*$ inherited from $G$. If $H \subsetneq G$, then $H$ is a *proper subgroup* of $G$, written $H < G$. A proper subgroup $H < G$ is *maximal* if there is no subgroup $K$ such that $H K < G$ such that $H < K$. Likewise, a nontrivial subgroup $H \leq G$ is *minimal* if there is no subgroup $K$ such that $\set{e} < K < H$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Subgroup criterion' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-2'>
Let $(G, *)$ be a group with identity element $e\in G$. A nonempty subset $H \subseteq G$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if for all $a, b \in H$

$$
\begin{equation*}
  a * b^{-1} \in H
\tag{\label{equation-20}}
\end{equation*}
$$

meaning that $H$ is closed under the operation $a * b^{-1}$. This is equivalent to the following two conditions:
1. **Closure under the group operation:**
$$
\begin{equation*}
  a, b \in H \implies a * b \in H
\tag{\label{equation-21}}
\end{equation*}
$$

2. **Closure under inverses:**
$$
\begin{equation*}
  a\in H \implies a^{-1} \in H
\tag{\label{equation-22}}
\end{equation*}
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**($\implies$):** Assume $H \leq G$. As a subgroup, $H$ satisfies the group axioms. In particular:
- $a\in H \implies a^{-1} \in H$
- $a, b \in H \implies a * b \in H$

Thus, for all $a, b \in H$, since $b^{-1} \in H$, it follows that $a * b^{-1} \in H$.

**($\impliedby$):** Assume $a * b^{-1} \in H$ for all $a, b\in H$. We show that $H$ satisfies the group axioms.

- **Associativity:** The operation $*$ is associative on $G$, and since $H \subseteq G$, it defines a restriction $*|_H : H\times H \to H$ on $H$, which is inherently associative.

- **Existence of identity element:** Since $H \neq\emptyset$ is nonempty, it must have an element $a\in H$. Consequently, $a * a^{-1} = e \in H$ by assumption.

- **Existence of inverses:** Since $e \in H$, then for any $h\in H$ we have by assumption $eh^{-1} = h^{-1} \in H$.

- **Closure:** Given $a, b \in H$, then $b^{-1} \in H$. It follows by assumption that $a * b = a * (b^{-1})^{-1} \in H$.

<MathBox title='Subgroups are preserved under intersection' boxType='proposition'>
Let $I\subseteq\N_0$ be an index set and let $\set{H_i}_{i\in I}$ be a set of subgroups of a group $G$. Then the intersection

$$
  H_\cap := \bigcap_{i\in I} H_i
$$

is also a subgroup of $G$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Since each $H_i$ is a subgroup of $G$, each contains the identity element $e_G$. Thus, $e_G \in H_i$ for all $i\in I$, and hence $e_G \in H_\cap$.

Let $g_1, g_2 \in H_\cap$. Then $g_1, g_2 \in H_i$ for every $i\in I$. Since each $H_i$ is a subgroup, it follows that $g_1 g_2 \in H_i$ for every $i\in I$, and therefore $g_1 g_2 \in H_\cap$.

Likewise, if $g\in H_\cap$, then $g\in H_i$ and thus $g^{-1} \in H_i$ for each $i\in I$, which implies that $g^{-1} \in H_\cap$ and completes the proof that $H_\cap$ is a subgroup.

<MathBox title='Torsion subgroup' boxType='definition'>
If $G$ is an Abelian group, the elements finite order form a subgroup $G_T$ of $G$, called the *torsion subgroup*.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Existence of smallest subgroups' boxType='proposition'>
For any subset $H$ of a group $G$, there is a smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $H$. It consists of all finite products of elements of $H$ and their inverses (repetitions allowed).

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The intersection $S$ of all subgroups of $G$ containing $H$ is again a subgroup containing $H$, and is evidently the smallest such group. Clearly, $S$ contains all finite products of elements of $H$ and their inverses. Since $H$ is a subgroup, the set of such products satisfies Proposition $\ref{proposition-2}$, and hence is a subgroup containing $H$. It therefore equals $S$.

<MathBox title='Generated group' boxType='definition'>
Let $K$ be a non-empty subset of a group $G$ and

$$
  S_K := \set{H \leq H | K \subseteq H}
$$

the set of all subgroups that contain $K$. Then

$$
  \braket{K} := \bigcap_{H \in S_K} H
$$

is defined as the group *generated* by $K$.

A group $G$ is finitely generated if there are $g_1,\dots,g_n \in G$ such that

$$
  G = \braket{g_1,\dots,g_n} := \braket{\set{g_1,\dots,g_n}}

### Cyclic groups

<MathBox title='Division algorithm' boxType='theorem' tag='theorem-1'>
Let $m\in\Z$ and $d\in\N_+$. Then there exists unique integers $q$ (quotient) and $r$ (remainder) such that

$$
  m = dq + r,\; 0\leq r < d
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

To prove existence of $q$ and $r$, consider the set of remainders $S =: \Set{m - qd | q\in\Z \land m - qd \geq 0}$. To show that $S$ is not empty, consider the two cases 
- if $m \geq 0$, then for $q = 0$, we have $a - 0\cdot d = a \in S$. 
- if $m < 0$ then for $q = m$ we have $0 \leq m - md = m(1 - d)\in S$ since $1 - d \leq 0$
Thus, $S$ is nonempty and by the well-ordering principle, $S$ has a least element, say $r = m - qd \geq 0$. Next, we show that $r < d$ by contradiction. Assuming $r \geq d$, we have $r - d \geq 0$. Since $r = m - qd$, we have

$$
  0 \leq r - d = m - qd - d = m - (q + 1)d \in S
$$

However, $m - (q + 1)d < r$ contradicting the fact that $r$ is the least element of $S$. This proves the existence of integers $q$ and $r$ with $0 \leq r < d$ such that $m = qd + r$.

To prove uniqueness, suppose there exists another pair of integers $q'$ and $r'$ such that $0 \leq r' < d$ and $m = q'd + r'$. Assuming $r \geq r'$ (the converse case is analogous), we have $r - r' \geq 0$. Since $m = qd + r = q'd + r'$ we know that $q'd - qd = r - r'$. However, $0 \leq r - r'$ so $0 \leq (q' - q)d < d$. This implies that $0 \leq q' - q < 1$. Since $q' - q$ is an integer, it follows that $q' - q = 0$ and $q' = q$. Then $r = m - qd = m - q'd = r'$.

<MathBox title='Cyclic group' boxType='definition'>
Let $G$ be a group. The subgroup generated by all integers powers of an element $g$, i.e.

$$
  \langle g \rangle = \Set{g^n | n\in\Z}
$$

is called the *cyclic subgroup* generated by $g$. The order of $g$ is $|\langle g\rangle|$, the number of elements in $\langle g\rangle$. A group $G$ is *cyclic* if it is generated by a single element, i.e. if $G = \langle g \rangle$ for some $g\in G$. 

A *finite cyclic group* $G$ of order $n$, denoted $C_n$, is the set

$$
  C_n = G = \Set{e,g,g^2,\dots,g^{n-1}},\quad g^i = g^j \iff i \equiv j \mod n
$$

In particular $g^0 = g^n = e$ and $g^{-1} = g^{n-1}$. Such a group is isomorphic to $(\Z_n = \Z/n\Z, +)$ under the bijection $g^i \mapsto i$.

An *infinite cyclic group* $G$, denoted $C_\infty$, is the set

$$
  C_\infty = G = \Set{\dots, r^{-i},\dots,r^{-1},e,r,\dots,r^i,\dots}
$$

which is isomorphic to $(\Z,+)$.

<MathBox title='Subgroups of cyclic groups a cyclic' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-3'>
Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $G = \langle g \rangle$ be a cyclic group for $g\in G$, and suppose $H \leq G$. If $H = \Set{1}$, then $H = \langle 1 \rangle$. Otherwise there is a smallest positive integer $d\in\N_+$ such that $g^d \in H$. We will show that $H = \langle g^d \rangle$. Let $h\in H$. Then $h = g^m$ for some integer $m\in\Z$. Applying the division algorithm (Theorem $\ref{theorem-1}$), we find integers $q$ and $r$ such that

$$
  m = dq + r,\; 0\leq r < d
$$

Then

$$
  h = g^m = g^{dq + r} = g^{dq} g^r = (g^d)^q g^r
$$

Hence $g^r = (a^d)^{-q} h \in H$. However, $0 \leq r < d$, and since $d$ is the smallest positive integer such that $g^d \in H$, we must have $r = 0$. Hence, $h = g^m = g^{dq} = (g^d)^q \in \langle g^d \rangle = H$.

  \braket{e_G} < \braket{g} < \braket{g, k} \leq H

which contradicts our assumption that $H$ is minimal.

Let $G = \langle g \rangle$ be a cyclic group of order $n$. For each $k$ dividing $n$, $G$ has a unique subgroup of order $k$, i.e. $\langle g^{n/k} \rangle$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Assuming $t = \frac{n}{k}$, it is easy to see that $\langle g^t \rangle$ is a subgroup of order $k$. Let $H$ be any subgroup of $G$ or order $k$. Then by the proof of Proposition $\ref{proposition-3}$, we have $H = \langle g^d \rangle$, where $d\in\N_+$ is the smallest positive integer such that $g^d \in H$. Applying the division algorithm (Theorem $\ref{theorem-1}$), we obtaing integers $q$ and $r$ such that

$$
  n = dq + r,\; 0 \leq r < d
$$

Thus, $1 = g^n = g^{dq + r} = (g^d)^q g^r$ and so $g^r = (g^d)^{-q} \in H$. Consequently, $r = 0$ and so $n = dq$. Also $k = |H| = |\langle g^d\rangle| = q = \frac{n}{d}$. Thus, $d = \frac{n}{k} = t$, i.e. $H = \langle g^d\rangle = \rangle g^t \rangle$.

## Independent group

<MathBox title='Independent group' boxType='definition'>
A subset $\set{g_1,\dots,g_k} \subseteq G$ of a group $G$ is *independent* if for any $g_j \in\set{g_1,\dots,g_k}$

$$
  g_j \notin \braket{\set{g_1,\dots,g_k}\setminus\set{g_j}}
$$
</MathBox>

Let $P$ denote a permutation of the index set $I = \set{1,\dots,k}$, that is, the map $P: I \to I$ given by $j \mapsto j$ is a bijection.

Independence of a subse $\set{g_1,\dots,g_k} \subseteq G$ of a group means that for every $a_1,\dots,a_k \in\set{0,1}$ and permutation $P$ we must have

$$
  \prod_{j=1}^k g_{P(j)}^{a_j} = e_G \implies a_j = 0,\; \forall j\in\set{1,\dots,k}
$$

This is because otherwise we would have for some $j$ and $P$

$$
  g_{P(j)} = g_{P(j-1)}^{-a_{j-1}} \cdots g_{P(1)}^{-a_1} g_{P(k)}^{-a_k}  g_{P(j+1)}^{-a_{j+1}} \in \braket{\set{g_1,\dots,g_k}\setminus\set{g_{P(j)}}}
$$

and since $P(j) \in\set{1,\dots,k}$ the set $\set{g_1,\dots,g_k}$ would not be independent.

## Cosets

<MathBox title='Left and right cosets' boxType='definition'>
Let $(G, *)$ be a group, $H$ a subgroup of $G$ and $g\in G$
- The *left coset* of $H$ by $g$ is $gH := \Set{g*h | h\in H}$
- The *right coset* of $H$ by $g$ is $Hg := \Set{h*g | h\in H}$

The set of left cosets of $H$ by elements of $G$ is denoted $G:H = \Set{gH | g\in G}$. The *index* of $H$ in $G$ is the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$, denoted $|G:H|$. Similarly, $H:G = \Set{Hg | g\in H}$ is the set of right cosets of $H$ be elements of $G$ with index $|H:G|$.

<MathBox title='Properties of left cosets' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-4'>
Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$.
1. An element $a\in G$ lies in a left coset $C$ of $H$ if and only if $C = aH$
2. Two left cosets are either disjoint or equal
3. $aH = bH$ if and only if $a^{-1} b \in H$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Certainly $a\in aH$. Conversely, if $a$ lies in the left coset $bH$, then $a = bh$ for some $h\in H$, and so

$$
  aH = bhH = bH
$$

**(2):** If $C$ and $C'$ are not disjoint, then they have a common element $a$, and $C = aH$ and $C' = aH$ by **(1)**.

**(3):** If $a^{-1} b\in H$, then $H = a^{-1} bH$, and so $aH = aa^{-1} bH = bH$. Conversely, if $aH = bH$, then $H = a^{-1} bH$, and so $a^{-1} b \in H$.

Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of a group $G$. Proposition $\ref{proposition-4}.2$ implies that the left cosets of $H$ cover $G$. In other words, the left cosets of $H$ that are disjoint form a partition of $G$. The left cosets of $H$ that are equal form equivalence classes on $G$.

<MathBox title='Equal left cosets are equivalence classes' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-5'>
Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. The relation $g\sim k$ if and only if $g^{-1} k \in H$ is an equivalence relation on $G$, and the equivalence classes are the left cosets of $H$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

We show that $g\sim k$ is an equivalence relation on $G$:
- **Reflexivity:** For $g\in G$, then $g^{-1} g = e \in H$ since $H\leq G$, so $g\sim g$.
- **Symmetry:** Let $g\sim k$. Then $g^{-1} k\in H$, so $(g^{-1} k)^{-1} \in H$ since $H$ is a subgroup. However, $(g^{-1}k)^{-1} = k^{-1} (g^{-1})^{-1} = k^{-1} g$, so $k\in g$.
- **Transitivity:** If $g\sim k$ and $k \sim l$, then $g^{-1} k \in H$ and $k^{-1} l \in H$. Thus, $(g^{-1} k)(k^{-1} l) \in H$ since $H$ is a subgroup. However, $g^{-1} kk^{-1} l = g^{-1} l$, so $g\sim l$.

To find the equivalence class under $\sim$, we have 

$$
  g\sim k \iff g^{-1}k = h\iff k = gh,\; h\in H
$$

Thus, the equivalence class of $g$ under $\sim$ is $\Set{gh | h\in H} = gH$.

Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. Each coset of $H$ has the same size as $H$, i.e.

$$
  |gH| = |H| = |Hg|
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

We will prove the case for left cosets. The proof for right cosets is analogous. The claim is proved by finding a bijection between $H$ and $gH$. Define the map $\alpha: H \to gH$ by $\alpha(h) = g*h$. W
- $\alpha$ is injective: if $\alpha(h_1) = \alpha(h_2)$ then $g*h_1 = g*h_2$, and multiplying on the left by $g^{-1}$ we get $h_1 = h_2$
- $\alpha$ is surjective: any element of $gH$ equals $g*h$ for some $h\in H$, and $a(h) = g*h$, so $g*h$ is in the image of $\alpha$.

Thus $\alpha$ is a bijection, and $|gH| = |H|$.

<MathBox title="Langrange's theorem" boxType='theorem'>
Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H$ be a subgroup. Then

In particular, the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let the distinct left cosets of $H$ in $H$ be $g_1 H, \dots, g_m H$, so $m = |G:H|$. By Proposition $\ref{proposition-5}$, the left cosets of $H$ are the equivalence classes for an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $G$. Thus, they form a partition of $G$, i.e.

$$
  |G| = \sum_{i=1}^m |g_i H|
$$

Since $|g_i H| = |H|$ by Proposition $\ref{proposition-6}$, we get $|G| = m|H| = |G:H|\cdot|H|$. The result for right cosets is similar.

<MathBox title="Extension of Langrange's theorem" boxType='theorem'>
If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ and $K$ is a subgroup of $H$, then

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $S$ be a set of coset representatives for $K$ in $H$, so $H = \bigsqcup_{s\in S} s K$, and $|S| = |H:K|$. For any $a \inG$, left multiplication by $a$ is a bijection $G \to G$, so $a H = \bigsqcup_{s\in S} asK$. Thus each left coset of $H$ decomposes into $|H:K|$ left cosets of $K$. Since $G$ decomposes into $|G:H|$ left cosets of $H$, each of which decomposes into $|H:K|$ left cosets of $K$, the total number $|G:K|$ of left cosets of $K$ in $G$ is $|G:H|\cdot|H:K|$.

<MathBox title='Cosets of integers' boxType='example'>
The set of $n$-multiples $n\Z = \Set{nz | z\in\Z}$ is a subgroup of $(\Z, +)$. The cosets of $n\Z$ in $\Z$ are the $n$ sets $n\Z, n\Z + 1,\dots,n\Z + (n-1)$, where $n\Z + i = \Set{i + nz | z\in\Z}$ is the congruence class of $i$ modulo $n$. The cosets partition $\Z$ into the disjoint union

$$
  \Z = \bigsqcup_{i=0}^n n\Z + i = n\Z \sqcup \left(\bigsqcup_{i=1}^n n\Z + i\right)

In this sense, $\Z$ is covered by cosets of congruence classes.

The centralized of a subset $S \subseteq G$ is defined as

The centralizer of any subset $S \subset G$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup of $G$, i.e.

Since $e_G g = ge_G$ for all $g \in G$, it follows that $e_G \in C_G (S)$.

Let $h_1, h_2 \in C_G (S)$. Then we have for every $g\in S$

  (h_1 h_2) g = h_1 (h_2 g) \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-18}} h_1 g h_2 \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-18}} g h_1 h_2

and thus $h_1 h_2 \in C_G (S)$.

Finally, for any $h\in C_G (S)$ and $g\in S$

$$
\begin{align*}
  hg \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-18}} gh \implies& gh^{-1} = h^{-1} \\

<MathBox title='The center is a normal subgroup' boxType='proposition'>
The centre of a group $G$ is a normal subgroup, i.e.

$$
  Z(G) \unlhd G
$$

It is a subgroup of $G$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The neutral element $e$ of $G$ clearly satisfies $eg = ge$ and so $e\in Z(G)$.

For any $h_1, h_2 \in Z(G)$ we have

$$
  h_1 h_2 g \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-25}} h_1 g h_2 \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-25}}
$$

and thus $h_1 h_2 \in Z(G)$, verifying $\eqref{equation-21}$.

Moreover, for any $h \in Z(G)$ and $g \in G$ we have $hg = gh$ which implies $gh^{-1} = h^{-1} g$ and the $h^{-1} \in Z(G)$, verifying $\eqref{equation-22}$

Finally, we find for any $g\in G$ that

$$
\begin{align*}
  Z(G)^G \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-23}}& \set{ghg^{-1} | h\in Z(G)} \\
  \underbrace{=}_{\eqref{equation-25}}& \set{hgg^{-1} | h\in Z(G)} = Z(G)

$$

Since $ge = eg = g$, it follows that $e \in Z(G)$ and $Z(G)\neq\emptyset$. For any $x,y \in Z(G)$, giving $gx = xg$ and $gy = yg$. Applying the group operation yields $(xy)g = x(yg) = x(gy) = (xg)y = (gx)y = g(xy)$, showing that $xy\in Z(G)$. For $x\in Z(G)$, we have $x^{-1} g = x^{-1} (ge) = x^{-1} (gx)x^{-1} = x^{-1} (xg) x^{-1} = (x^{-1}x)gx^{-1} = (eg)x^{-1} = gx^{-1}$, showing that $x^{-1} \in Z(G)$. Hence, $Z(G)$ is a subgroup.

Let $g \in G$ be any element of $G$. Since $e\in H$, it follows from $\eqref{equation-19}$ that $e\in H^g$.

Now let $h' \in H^g$, that is, there exists $h\in H$ such that $h' = ghg^{-1}$. However, we also have from $\eqref{equation-19}$ that $gh^{-1} g^{-1} \in H^g$. Thus,

$$
  h' (gh^{-1} g^{-1}) = ghg^{-1} gh^{-1} g^{-1} = e

and thus $(h')^{-1} = gh^{-1} g^{-1} \in H^g$, which shows that $\eqref{equation-22}$ is satisfied for $H^g$.

Finally, let $h'_2, h'_2 \in H^g$, which, due to $\eqref{equation-19}$, means that there exist $h_1, h_2 \in H$ such that $h'_j = gh_j g^{-1}$ for $j\in\set{1,2}$. Since $h_1 h_2 \in H$, it follows that

$$
  h'_1 h'_2 = (gh_1 g^{-1})(gh_2 g^{-1}) = gh_1 h_2 g^{-1} \in H^g

Suppose $N$ is a subgroup of $G$ satisfying $g^{-1} N g \subseteq N$ for all $g\in G$. Then for all $n\in N$, we have

Clearly,

Thus, if $N$ is normal, then every left coset is a right coset. Conversely, if the left coset $gN$ is also a right coset, then it must be the right coset by Proposition $\ref{proposition-4}$. Hence, $gN = Ng$, and so $gNg^{-1}= N$.

Every normal subgroup occurs as the kernel of a homomorphism. More precisely, if $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then there is a unique group structure on the set $G/N$ of cosets of $N$ in $G$ for which the natural map $a\mapsto [a]: G \to G/N$ is a homomorphism.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Write the cosets as left cosets, and define $(aN)(bN) = (ab)N$. We have to check **(1)** that this is well-defined, and **(2)** that it gives a group structure on the set of cosets. It will then be obvious that the map $g\mapsto gN$ is a homomorphism with kernel $N$.
1. Let $aN = a'N$ and $bN = b'N$. We have to show that $abN = a'b'N$. However, by proposition

$$
  abN = a(bN) = a(b'N) = aNb' = a'Nb' = a'b'N
$$
2. The product is certainly associate, the coset $N$ is an identity element, and $a^{-1} N$ is an inverse for $aN$.

If $b = \alpha(a)$ and $b' = \alpha(a')$, then $bb' = \alpha(aa')$ and $b^{-1} = \alpha(a^{-1})$, and so $I := \alpha(G)$ is a subgroup of $G'$. The universal property of quotients (Proposition $\ref{proposition-16}$) shows that the map $x\mapsto \alpha(x):G\to I$ defines a homomorphism $\bar{\alpha}:G/N\to I$ with $\bar{\alpha}(gN) = \alpha(g)$. The homomorphism $\bar{\alpha}$ is certainly surjective, and if $\bar{\alpha} (gN) = e$, then $g\in\ker(\alpha) = N$. Thus, $\bar{\alpha}$ has a trivial kernel, making it injective.

<MathBox title='Isomorphism theorem' boxType='theorem'>
Let $G$ be a group, $H$ a subgroup of $G$ and $N$ a normal subgroup of $G$. Then $H\cap N$ is normal in $H$ and $H/(H\cap N) \cong NH/N$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

By Proposition $\ref{proposition-13}$, $HN$ is a subgroup. Consider the map $h\mapsto hN: H\to G/N$. This is a homomorphism, and its kernel is $H\cap N$, which is therefore normal in $H$. By Theorem $\ref{theorem-2}$, the map induces an isomorphism $H/(H\cap N) \to I$, where $I$ is its image. However, $I$ is the set of cosets of the form $hN$ with $h\in H$, i.e., $I = HN/N$.

<MathBox title='Correspondence theorem' boxType='theorem' tag='theorem-6'>
Let $\alpha: G\to \bar{G}$ be a surjective homomorphism, and let $N = \ker{\alpha}$. Then there is a bijection

$$
  \Set{\text{subgroup of }G\text{ containing }N} \leftrightarrow {\text{subgroup of }G}
$$

under which a subgroup $H$ of $G$ containing $N$ corresponds to $\bar{H} = \alpha(H)$ and a subgroup $\bar{H}$ of $\bar{G}$ corresponds to $H = \alpha^{-1} (\bar{H})$. Moreover, if $H \cong \bar{H}$ and $H' \cong \bar{H}'$, then
1. $\bar{H} \subset \bar{H}' \iff H \subset H'$, in which case $|\bar{H}': \bar{H}| = |H': H|$
2. $\bar{H}$ is normal in $\bar{G}$ if and only if $H$ is normal in $G$, in which case, $\alpha$ induces an isomorphism
$$
  G/H \cong \bar{G}/\bar{H}
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $\bar{H}$ is a subgroup of $\bar{G}$, then $\alpha^{-1}(\bar{H})$ is easily seen to be a subgroup of $G$ containing $N$, and if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $\alpha(H)$ is a subgroup of $\bar{G}$. Clearly, $\alpha^{-1} \alpha(H) = HN$, which equals $H$ if and only if $H \supset N$, and $\alpha\alpha^{-1} (\bar{H}) = \bar{H}$. Thus, the two operations give the required bijection. The remaining statements are easily verified. For example, a decomposition $H' = \bigsqcup_{i\in I} a_i H$ of $H'$ into a disjoint union of left cosets of $H$ gives a similar decomposition $H' = \bigsqcup_{i\in I} \alpha(a_i) \bar{H}$ of $\bar{H}'$.

## Direct products

<MathBox title='Direct product of group' boxType='definition'>
A group $G$ is a *direct product* of its subgroups $H_1,\dots,H_k$ if the map

$$
  (h_1,\dots,h_k) \mapsto h_1\cdot h_k: H_1 \times\cdots\times H_k \to G
$$

is an isomorphism of groups. This means that each element $g$ of $G$ can be written uniquely in the form $g = h_1\cdots h_k$, and that if $g = h_1\cdots h_k$ and $g' = h'_1 \cdots h_k'$, then

$$
  gg' = (h_1 h'_1)\cdots(h_k h'_k)
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Criteria for direct products of groups' boxType='proposition'>
A group $G$ is a direct product of subgroups $H_1$ and $H_2$ if and only if
1. $G = H_1 H_2$
2. $H_1 \cap H_2 = \Set{e}$
3. $h_1 h_2 = h_2 h_1$ for all $h_1 \in H_1$ and $h_2 \in H_2$
4. $H_1 \unlhd G$ and $H_2 \unlhd G$ 

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $G$ is the direct product of $H_1$ and $H_2$, then certainly **(1)** and **(3)** hold, and **(2)** holds because, for any $g\in H_1 \cap H_2$, the element $(g, g^{-1})$ maps to $e$ under $(h_1, h_2) \mapsto h_1 h_2$ and so equals $(e,e)$.

Conversely, **(3)** implies that $(h_1, h_2)\mapsto h_1 h_2$ is a homomorphism, and **(2)** implies that it is injective

$$
  h_1 h_2 = e \mapsto h_1 = h_2^{-1} \in H_1 \cap H_2 = \Set{e}
$$

Finally, **(1)** implies that it is injective.

Two elements $h_1, h_2$ of a group commute if and only if their commutator

$$
  [h_1, h_2] := (h_1 h_2)(h_2 h_1)^{-1} = e
$$

However,

$$
  (h_1 h_2)(h_2 h_1)^{-1} = h_1 h_2 h_1^{-1} h_2^{-1} = \begin{cases}
    (h_1 h_2 h_1^{-1})\cdot h_2^{-1} \\
    h_1 \cdot (h_2 h_1^{-1} h_2^{-1})
  \end{cases} 
$$

which is in $H_2$ because $H_2$ is normal, and is in $H_1$ because $H_1$ is normal. Thus, **(2)** implies $[h_1, h_2] = e$.

# Matrix groups

<MathBox title='General linear group' boxType='definition'>
The general linear group of degree $n$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$, denoted $\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$, is the set of all invertible $n\times n$-matrices under matrix multiplication, i.e.

$$
  \mathrm{GL}_n (\R) = \Set{\mathbf{A}\in \mathcal{M}_n (\R) : \det(\mathbf{A}) \neq 0}
$$

When $n\geq 2$, the group $\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ is not Abelian.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

To prove that $\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ is a group for $n\in\N_+$ we need to show that it satisfies the group axioms. Recall that a $n\times n$-matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{F}^{n\times n}$ is invertible if $\det(\mathbf{A}) \neq 0$.

**Closure:** Let $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}\in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ be invertible matrices. Then

$$
  \det(\mathbf{AB}) = \det(\mathbf{A})\det(\mathbf{B}) \neq 0 \implies \mathbf{AB}\in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})
$$

This shows that the matrix product of two invertible matrices is again invertible.

**Associativity:** If $\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B},\mathbf{C}\in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ then by associativity of matrix multiplication

$$
  (\mathbf{AB})\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{BC}) \in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})
$$

**Identity element:** The $n\times n$ identity matrix $\mathbf{I}_n = \mathrm{diag}(1)_{i=1}^n$ is invertible since $det(\mathbf{I}_n) = 1$, implying that $\mathbf{I}_n \in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$. Furthermore, for any $\mathbf{A}\in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ we have

**Inverse element:** Any $\mathbf{A}\in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ is invertible by definition with a unique inverse $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$. Since $\det(\mathbf{A}^{-1}) = \det(\mathbf{A})^{-1} \neq 0$, it follows that $\mathbf{A}^{-1} \in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$. By definition of the matrix inverse we have $\mathbf{AA}^{-1} = \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}_n$.

<MathBox title='Special linear group' boxType='definition'>
The special linear group of degree $n$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$, denoted $\mathrm{SL}_n (\mathbb{F})$, is the set of all invertible $n\times n$ matrices with unit determinant:

  \mathrm{SL}_n (\R) = \Set{\mathbf{A}\in \mathrm{GL}_n (\R) : \det(\mathbf{A}) = 1}
$$

<MathBox title='Unitary group' boxType='definition'>
The unitary group of degree $n$, denoted $\mathrm{U}(n)$, is the set of all complex unitary $n\times n$ matrices, i.e.

$$
  \mathrm{U}(n) = \Set{\mathbf{A}\in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{C}) : \mathbf{AA}^\dagger = \mathbf{I}_n}
$$

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

For $\mathbf{U}\in U(n)$ we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \det(\mathbf{UU}^\dagger) =& \det(\mathbf{U})\det(\mathbf{U}^\dagger) \\
  =& \det(\mathbf{U})\overline{\det(\mathbf{U}^\top)} \\
  =& \det(\mathbf{U})\overline{\det(\mathbf{U})} \\
  =& \det(\mathbf{I}_n) = 1
\end{align*}
$$

showing that $\det(\mathbf{U}) = e^{i\theta}$.
