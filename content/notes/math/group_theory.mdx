# Group 

<MathBox title='Group' boxType='definition'>
A group is a non-empty set $G$ and a binary operation $*: G \times G \to G$, written as the pair $(G, *)$, with the properties
- $a, b\in G \implies a * b \in G$ **(closure)**
- $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c) \in G, \; \forall a,b,c\in\mathbb{G}$ **(associativity)**
- $\exists e\in G : a * e = e * a = a, \; \forall a\in G$ **(existence of an identity/neutral element)**
- $\forall a\in G,\; \exists g^{-1}\in G : g * g^{-1} = e$ **(existence of inverse elements)**

A group $(G, *)$ is *Abelian* or *commutative* if $*$ also satisfies 
- $a * b = b * a$ for all $a,b \in G$ **(commutativity)** 

Note that the closure property follows implicitly from the fact that $*$ is a binary operation on $G$, and is thus sometimes not listed as a group axiom. The group operation is usually referred to as *(group) multiplication*, in which case the operation of two group elements is called a *product*. The group operation $*$ is also usually denoted by $\circ$ or $\cdot$. To simplify notation, it is common to omit the group operation symbol.

If the group operation is addition, the group is called *additive* and the inverse of $a$ is the negative $-a$. Similarly, if the group operation is multiplication, the group is called *multiplicative* and the inverse of $a$ is denoted $a^{-1}$.

The existence of inverse elements implies that the cancellation laws holds in groups

$$
\begin{align*}
  ab =& ac \implies b = c \\
  ba =& ca \implies b = c
\end{align*}
$$

Conversely, if $G$ is finite, cancellation laws imply the existence of inverse elements. The map $G \ni x\mapsto ax \in G$ is injective, and hence bijective by counting. In particular, $e$ is in the image, and so $a$ has a right inverse. Similarly, it has a left inverse, and by uniqueness the two inverses are equal.

<MathBox title='The identity element is its own inverse' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-1'>
If $(G, *)$ is a group with identity element $e$ and $a\in G$, then $a*a = a$ implies $a = e$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $b\in G$ be such that $b*a = e$. Then $b*(a*a) = b*a$ and thus

$$
  a = e*a = (b*a)*a = b*(a*a) = b*a = e
$$
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Uniqueness of identity and inverses' boxType='definition'>
Let $(G, *)$ be a group with identity element $e$. Then for $a,b\in G$
1. If $b*a = e$, then $a*b = e$
2. For all $a\in G$ there is a unique $e$ such that $a*e = a$
3. For all $a\in G$ there is a unique $b\in G$ such that $b*a = e$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Suppose $b*a = e$, then

$$
  (a*b)*(a*b) = a*(b*a)*b = a*e*b = a*b
$$

By Proposition $\ref{proposition-1}$, it follows that $a*e = e$.

**(2):** Suppose $a\in G$ and øet $b\in G$ be such that $b*a = e$. By **(1)**, we have

$$
  a*e = a*(b*a) = (a*b) * a = e*a = a
$$

To show uniqueness, suppose $a*e = a$ and $a*f = a$ for all $a*G$. Then

$$
  (e*f)*(e*f) = e*(f*e)*f = e*f*e = e*f
$$

Proposition $\ref{proposition-1}$ implies that $e*f = e$. Thus

$$
  f*f = (f*e)*(f*e) = f*(e*f)*e = f*e*e = f*e = f
$$

Again from Proposition $\ref{proposition-1}$ it follows that $f = e$.

**(3):** Suppose $b_1 * a = e$ and $b_2 * a = e$. Then by **(1)** and **(2)**

$$
  b_1 = b_1 * e = b_1 * (a*b_2) = (b_1 * a) * b_2 = e*b_2 = b_2
$$

<MathBox title='Group isomorphism' boxType='definition'>
Two groups $(G, *)$ and $(H,\circ)$ are *isomorphic* if there is a bijection $\alpha:H\to G$ such that

$$
  \alpha(a * b) = \alpha(a) \circ\alpha(b),\; \forall a,b\in G
$$

The mapping $\alpha$ is called an *isomorphism* and we say that $G$ is isomorphic to $H$, denoted $G \cong H$. If $\alpha$ is not bijective, it is called a *homomorphism*. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Group order' boxType='definition'>
The *order* $|G|$ of a group $G$ is its cardinality. A finite group whose order is a power of a prime $p$ is called a *p*-group. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Group element order' boxType='definition'>
For an element $a$ of a group $(G, *)$, define
- $a^n = \underbrace{a * \cdots * a}_{n \text{ times}}$
- $a^{-n} = (a^{-1})^n = \underbrace{a^{-1} * \cdots * a^{-1}}_{n \text{ times}}$
- $a^0 = e$

With the exponentiation rules for all $m, n\in\Z$

$$
\begin{align*}
  a^m a^n =& a^{m+n} \\
  (a^m)^n =& a^{mn}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that the set

$$
  \Set{n\in\Z | a^n = e}
$$

is an ideal in $\Z$, and so equals $m\Z$ for $m\in\N$. When $m = 0$, then $a^n \neq e$ unless $n \neq 0$, and $a$ is said to have *infinite order*. When $m \neq 0$, it is the smallest integer $m > 0$ such that $a^m = e$, and $a$ is said to have *finite order* $n$. In this case, $a^{-1} = a^{m-1}$, and

$$
  a^n = e \iff m|n
$$

<MathBox title='Integers under addition form a group' boxType='example'>
The set of integers $\Z = \Set{ n }_{n=-\infty}^\infty$ with standard addition forms an infinite discrete Abelian group, denoted $(\Z, +)$. Addition on $\Z$ is associative and commutative with identity element $e = 0$ and inverse elements $a^{-1} = -a$ for all $a\in\Z$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Congruence classes under addition form a group' boxType='example'>
The set of congruence classes modulo $n\in\N_+$

$$
\begin{gather*}
  \Z_n := \Z / n\Z = \Set{[i]_n}_{i=0}^{n-1} \\
  [a]_n = \Set{b\in\Z | a - b = kn,\; k\in\Z }
\end{gather*}
$$

are finite cyclic groups $\Z_n$ of order $n$, where the binary operation is addition modulo $n$. Since $+$ is associative on $\Z$, we have for $[a]_n, [b]_n, [c]_n \in \Z_n$

$$
  [a]_n + ([b]_n + [c]_n) = [a]_n + [b + c]_n = [a + b + c]_n
$$

and

$$
  ([a]_n + [b]_n) + [c]_n = [a + b]_n + [c]_n = [a + b + c]_n
$$

showing that modular addition is associative. The identity element is $[0]_n$, while inverse elements are of the form $[a]_n^{-1} = [-a]_n$ for all $a\in\Z$.

The simplest non-trivial case is $\Z_2 = \Set{0,1}$ with three possibilities of addition

$$
  0 + 0 = 0,\quad 0 + 1 = 1,\quad 1 + 1 = 0
$$

Defining the bijections $0 \leftrightarrow 1$ and $1 \leftrightarrow -1$, the group $\Z_2$ is isomorphic to the group $G = \Set{-1, 1}$ equipped with standard multiplication and identity element $e = 1$. The latter group $G$ has three possibilities of multiplication

$$
  1\cdot 1 = 1,\quad 1\cdot (-1) = -1,\quad (-1)\cdot(-1) = 1
$$

In general, $\Z_n$ is isomorphic to the group forming the $n$-th roots of unity, $G = \Set{e^{2\pi i k/n} | k=1,\dots,n-1}$, equipped with standard multiplication.

## Subgroups

<MathBox title='Subgroup' boxType='definition'>
Let $(G, *)$ be a group. A nonempty subset $H \subseteq G$ is a *subgroup* of $G$ if $H$ is a group under the binary operation $*:G\times G$. This is commonly denoted $H \leq G$. If $H \subset G$, then $H$ is a *proper subgroup* of $G$, written $H < G$. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Subgroup criterion' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-2'>
Let $(G, *)$ be a group. A subset $H \subseteq G$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if
1. $a,b\in H \implies a*b \in H$ **(closure)**
2. $a\in H \implies a^{-1} \in H$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

By **(1)**, the binary operation on $G$ defines a restriction $*|_H :H\times H \to H$ on $H$, which is inherently associative. By assumption, $H$ contains at least one element $a$, its inverse $a^{-1}$, and the product $aa^{-1}$. By **(2)**, the inverse of elements in $H$ lie in $H$. 
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Intersection of subgroups' boxType='proposition'>
An intersection of subgroups of $G$ is a subgroup of $G$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

An intersection of subgroups of $G$ is nonempty and contains $e$, and the subgroup criterion obviously holds (Proposition $\ref{proposition-2}$).
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='The center is a subgroup' boxType='proposition'>
The centre of a group $G$ is the subset

$$
  Z(G) = \Set{g\in G | gx = xg,\;\forall x\in G}
$$

It is a subgroup of $G$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Since $ge = eg = g$, it follows that $e \in Z(G)$ and $Z(G)\neq\emptyset$. For any $x,y \in Z(G)$, giving $gx = xg$ and $gy = yg$. Applying the group operation yields $(xy)g = x(yg) = x(gy) = (xg)y = (gx)y = g(xy)$, showing that $xy\in Z(G)$. For $x\in Z(G)$, we have $x^{-1} g = x^{-1} (ge) = x^{-1} (gx)x^{-1} = x^{-1} (xg) x^{-1} = (x^{-1}x)gx^{-1} = (eg)x^{-1} = gx^{-1}$, showing that $x^{-1} \in Z(G)$. Hence, $Z(G)$ is a subgroup.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Torsion subgroup' boxType='definition'>
If $G$ is an Abelian group, the elements finite order form a subgroup $G_T$ of $G$, called the *torsion subgroup*.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Existence of smallest subgroups' boxType='proposition'>
For any subset $H$ of a group $G$, there is a smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $H$. It consists of all finite products of elements of $H$ and their inverses (repetitions allowed).

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The intersection $S$ of all subgroups of $G$ containing $H$ is again a subgroup containing $H$, and is evidently the smallest such group. Clearly, $S$ contains all finite products of elements of $H$ and their inverses. Since $H$ is a subgroup, the set of such products satisfies Proposition $\ref{proposition-2}$, and hence is a subgroup containing $H$. It therefore equals $S$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Generated subgroup' boxType='definition'>
If $G$ is a group with subset $H \subseteq G$, the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $H$ is denoted $\langle H\rangle$ and is called the *subgroup generated* by $H$. We also say that $H$ *generates* $\langle H\rangle$.
</MathBox>

### Cyclic groups

<MathBox title='Division algorithm' boxType='theorem' tag='theorem-1'>
Let $m\in\Z$ and $d\in\N_+$. Then there exists unique integers $q$ (quotient) and $r$ (remainder) such that

$$
  m = dq + r,\; 0\leq r < d
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

To prove existence of $q$ and $r$, consider the set of remainders $S =: \Set{m - qd | q\in\Z \land m - qd \geq 0}$. To show that $S$ is not empty, consider the two cases 
- if $m \geq 0$, then for $q = 0$, we have $a - 0\cdot d = a \in S$. 
- if $m < 0$ then for $q = m$ we have $0 \leq m - md = m(1 - d)\in S$ since $1 - d \leq 0$
Thus, $S$ is nonempty and by the well-ordering principle, $S$ has a least element, say $r = m - qd \geq 0$. Next, we show that $r < d$ by contradiction. Assuming $r \geq d$, we have $r - d \geq 0$. Since $r = m - qd$, we have

$$
  0 \leq r - d = m - qd - d = m - (q + 1)d \in S
$$

However, $m - (q + 1)d < r$ contradicting the fact that $r$ is the least element of $S$. This proves the existence of integers $q$ and $r$ with $0 \leq r < d$ such that $m = qd + r$.

To prove uniqueness, suppose there exists another pair of integers $q'$ and $r'$ such that $0 \leq r' < d$ and $m = q'd + r'$. Assuming $r \geq r'$ (the converse case is analogous), we have $r - r' \geq 0$. Since $m = qd + r = q'd + r'$ we know that $q'd - qd = r - r'$. However, $0 \leq r - r'$ so $0 \leq (q' - q)d < d$. This implies that $0 \leq q' - q < 1$. Since $q' - q$ is an integer, it follows that $q' - q = 0$ and $q' = q$. Then $r = m - qd = m - q'd = r'$.

</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Cyclic group' boxType='definition'>
Let $G$ be a group. The subgroup generated by all integers powers of an element $g$, i.e.

$$
  \langle g \rangle = \Set{g^n | n\in\Z}
$$

is called the *cyclic subgroup* generated by $g$. The order of $g$ is $|\langle g\rangle|$, the number of elements in $\langle g\rangle$. A group $G$ is *cyclic* if it is generated by a single element, i.e. if $G = \langle g \rangle$ for some $g\in G$. 

A *finite cyclic group* $G$ of order $n$, denoted $C_n$, is the set

$$
  C_n = G = \Set{e,g,g^2,\dots,g^{n-1}},\quad g^i = g^j \iff i \equiv j \mod n
$$

In particular $g^0 = g^n = e$ and $g^{-1} = g^{n-1}$. Such a group is isomorphic to $(\Z_n = \Z/n\Z, +)$ under the bijection $g^i \mapsto i$.

An *infinite cyclic group* $G$, denoted $C_\infty$, is the set

$$
  C_\infty = G = \Set{\dots, r^{-i},\dots,r^{-1},e,r,\dots,r^i,\dots}
$$

which is isomorphic to $(\Z,+)$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Subgroups of cyclic groups a cyclic' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-3'>
Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $G = \langle g \rangle$ be a cyclic group for $g\in G$, and suppose $H \leq G$. If $H = \Set{1}$, then $H = \langle 1 \rangle$. Otherwise there is a smallest positive integer $d\in\N_+$ such that $g^d \in H$. We will show that $H = \langle g^d \rangle$. Let $h\in H$. Then $h = g^m$ for some integer $m\in\Z$. Applying the division algorithm (Theorem $\ref{theorem-1}$), we find integers $q$ and $r$ such that

$$
  m = dq + r,\; 0\leq r < d
$$

Then

$$
  h = g^m = g^{dq + r} = g^{dq} g^r = (g^d)^q g^r
$$

Hence $g^r = (a^d)^{-q} h \in H$. However, $0 \leq r < d$, and since $d$ is the smallest positive integer such that $g^d \in H$, we must have $r = 0$. Hence, $h = g^m = g^{dq} = (g^d)^q \in \langle g^d \rangle = H$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $G = \langle g \rangle$ be a cyclic group of order $n$. For each $k$ dividing $n$, $G$ has a unique subgroup of order $k$, i.e. $\langle g^{n/k} \rangle$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Assuming $t = \frac{n}{k}$, it is easy to see that $\langle g^t \rangle$ is a subgroup of order $k$. Let $H$ be any subgroup of $G$ or order $k$. Then by the proof of Proposition $\ref{proposition-3}$, we have $H = \langle g^d \rangle$, where $d\in\N_+$ is the smallest positive integer such that $g^d \in H$. Applying the division algorithm (Theorem $\ref{theorem-1}$), we obtaing integers $q$ and $r$ such that

$$
  n = dq + r,\; 0 \leq r < d
$$

Thus, $1 = g^n = g^{dq + r} = (g^d)^q g^r$ and so $g^r = (g^d)^{-q} \in H$. Consequently, $r = 0$ and so $n = dq$. Also $k = |H| = |\langle g^d\rangle| = q = \frac{n}{d}$. Thus, $d = \frac{n}{k} = t$, i.e. $H = \langle g^d\rangle = \rangle g^t \rangle$. 
</details>
</MathBox>

## Cosets

<MathBox title='Left and right cosets' boxType='definition'>
Let $(G, *)$ be a group, $H$ a subgroup of $G$ and $g\in G$
- The *left coset* of $H$ by $g$ is $gH := \Set{g*h | h\in H}$
- The *right coset* of $H$ by $g$ is $Hg := \Set{h*g | h\in H}$

The set of left cosets of $H$ by elements of $G$ is denoted $G:H = \Set{gH | g\in G}$. The *index* of $H$ in $G$ is the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$, denoted $|G:H|$. Similarly, $H:G = \Set{Hg | g\in H}$ is the set of right cosets of $H$ be elements of $G$ with index $|H:G|$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Properties of left cosets' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-4'>
Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$.
1. An element $a\in G$ lies in a left coset $C$ of $H$ if and only if $C = aH$
2. Two left cosets are either disjoint or equal
3. $aH = bH$ if and only if $a^{-1} b \in H$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Certainly $a\in aH$. Conversely, if $a$ lies in the left coset $bH$, then $a = bh$ for some $h\in H$, and so

$$
  aH = bhH = bH
$$

**(2):** If $C$ and $C'$ are not disjoint, then they have a common element $a$, and $C = aH$ and $C' = aH$ by **(1)**.

**(3):** If $a^{-1} b\in H$, then $H = a^{-1} bH$, and so $aH = aa^{-1} bH = bH$. Conversely, if $aH = bH$, then $H = a^{-1} bH$, and so $a^{-1} b \in H$.
</details>
</MathBox>

Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of a group $G$. Proposition $\ref{proposition-4}.2$ implies that the left cosets of $H$ cover $G$. In other words, the left cosets of $H$ that are disjoint form a partition of $G$. The left cosets of $H$ that are equal form equivalence classes on $G$.

<MathBox title='Equal left cosets are equivalence classes' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-5'>
Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. The relation $g\sim k$ if and only if $g^{-1} k \in H$ is an equivalence relation on $G$, and the equivalence classes are the left cosets of $H$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

We show that $g\sim k$ is an equivalence relation on $G$:
- **Reflexivity:** For $g\in G$, then $g^{-1} g = e \in H$ since $H\leq G$, so $g\sim g$.
- **Symmetry:** Let $g\sim k$. Then $g^{-1} k\in H$, so $(g^{-1} k)^{-1} \in H$ since $H$ is a subgroup. However, $(g^{-1}k)^{-1} = k^{-1} (g^{-1})^{-1} = k^{-1} g$, so $k\in g$.
- **Transitivity:** If $g\sim k$ and $k \sim l$, then $g^{-1} k \in H$ and $k^{-1} l \in H$. Thus, $(g^{-1} k)(k^{-1} l) \in H$ since $H$ is a subgroup. However, $g^{-1} kk^{-1} l = g^{-1} l$, so $g\sim l$.

To find the equivalence class under $\sim$, we have 

$$
  g\sim k \iff g^{-1}k = h\iff k = gh,\; h\in H
$$

Thus, the equivalence class of $g$ under $\sim$ is $\Set{gh | h\in H} = gH$.

</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Cosets of a subgroup share same order' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-6'>
Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. Each coset of $H$ has the same size as $H$, i.e.

$$
  |gH| = |H| = |Hg|
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

We will prove the case for left cosets. The proof for right cosets is analogous. The claim is proved by finding a bijection between $H$ and $gH$. Define the map $\alpha: H \to gH$ by $\alpha(h) = g*h$. W
- $\alpha$ is injective: if $\alpha(h_1) = \alpha(h_2)$ then $g*h_1 = g*h_2$, and multiplying on the left by $g^{-1}$ we get $h_1 = h_2$
- $\alpha$ is surjective: any element of $gH$ equals $g*h$ for some $h\in H$, and $a(h) = g*h$, so $g*h$ is in the image of $\alpha$.

Thus $\alpha$ is a bijection, and $|gH| = |H|$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title="Langrange's theorem" boxType='theorem'>
Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H$ be a subgroup. Then

$$
  |G| = |G:H|\cdot|H| = |H:G|\cdot|H|
$$

In particular, the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let the distinct left cosets of $H$ in $H$ be $g_1 H, \dots, g_m H$, so $m = |G:H|$. By Proposition $\ref{proposition-5}$, the left cosets of $H$ are the equivalence classes for an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $G$. Thus, they form a partition of $G$, i.e.

$$
  |G| = \sum_{i=1}^m |g_i H|
$$

Since $|g_i H| = |H|$ by Proposition $\ref{proposition-6}$, we get $|G| = m|H| = |G:H|\cdot|H|$. The result for right cosets is similar.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title="Extension of Langrange's theorem" boxType='theorem'>
If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ and $K$ is a subgroup of $H$, then

$$
  |G:K| = |G:H|\cdot|H:K|
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $S$ be a set of coset representatives for $K$ in $H$, so $H = \bigsqcup_{s\in S} s K$, and $|S| = |H:K|$. For any $a \inG$, left multiplication by $a$ is a bijection $G \to G$, so $a H = \bigsqcup_{s\in S} asK$. Thus each left coset of $H$ decomposes into $|H:K|$ left cosets of $K$. Since $G$ decomposes into $|G:H|$ left cosets of $H$, each of which decomposes into $|H:K|$ left cosets of $K$, the total number $|G:K|$ of left cosets of $K$ in $G$ is $|G:H|\cdot|H:K|$. 
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Cosets of integers' boxType='example'>
The set of $n$-multiples $n\Z = \Set{nz | z\in\Z}$ is a subgroup of $(\Z, +)$. The cosets of $n\Z$ in $\Z$ are the $n$ sets $n\Z, n\Z + 1,\dots,n\Z + (n-1)$, where $n\Z + i = \Set{i + nz | z\in\Z}$ is the congruence class of $i$ modulo $n$. The cosets partition $\Z$ into the disjoint union

$$
  \Z = \bigsqcup_{i=0}^n n\Z + i = n\Z \sqcup \left(\bigsqcup_{i=1}^n n\Z + i\right)
$$

In this sense, $\Z$ is covered by cosets of congruence classes.
</MathBox>

### Normal subgroups

<MathBox title='Normal subgroup' boxType='definition'>
Let $G$ be a group. A subgroup $N$ of $G$ is *normal* if $g^{-1}Ng = N$ for all $g\in G$. This is written $N \unlhd G$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='First normal subgroup criterion' boxType='proposition'>
A subgroup $N$ of $G$ is *normal* if and only if $g^{-1}Ng \subseteq N$ for all $g\in G$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Suppose $N$ is a subgroup of $G$ satisfying $g^{-1} N g \subseteq N$ for all $g\in G$. Then for all $n\in N$, we have

$$
  gng^{-1} = (g^{-1})^{-1} n (g^{-1}) = n' \in N
$$

for some $n'$, because $(g^{-1}) \in G$. Solving for $n$ we find

$$
  n = g^{-1} n' g \in g^{-1}N g
$$

Hence $N\subseteq g^{-1} N g$ and so $N = g^{-1} N g$. Thus, $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.

The converse is obvious.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Second normal subgroup criterion' boxType='proposition'>
A subgroup $N$ of $G$ is *normal* if and only if every left coset of $N$ in $G$ is also a right coset, in which case, $gN = Ng$ for all $g\in G$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Clearly,

$$
  gNg^{-1} = N \iff gN = Ng
$$

Thus, if $N$ is normal, then every left coset is a right coset. Conversely, if the left coset $gN$ is also a right coset, then it must be the right coset by Proposition $\ref{proposition-4}$. Hence, $gN = Ng$, and so $gNg^{-1}= N$. 
</details>
</MathBox>

The criterions for normal subgroups say that, in order for $N$ to be normal, we must have that for all $g\in G$ and $n\in N$, there exists an $n' \in N$ such that $gn = n'g$ (equivalently, for all $g\in G$ and $n\in N$, there exists an $n'$ such that $ng = gn'$).

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-13'>
If $H$ and $N$ are subgroups of $G$, and $N$ is normal, then $HN$ is a subgroup of $G$. If $H$ is also normal, then $HN$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.

The set $HN$ is nonempty, and

$$
  (h_1 n_1)(h_2 n_2) = h_1 h_2 n'_1 n_2 \in HN
$$

showing that it is closed under multiplication. Since

$$
  (hn)^{-1} = n^{-1} h^{-1} = h^{-1} n' \in HN
$$

it is also closed under the formation of inverses, and so $HN$ is a subgroup. If both $H$ and $N$ are normal, then

$$
  gHNg^{-1} = gHg^{-1} \cdot gNg^{-1} = HN
$$

for all $g\in G$.

### Kernels and quotients

<MathBox title='Kernel of homomorphisms' boxType='definition'>
The *kernel* of a group homomorphism $\alpha:G\to G'$ is

$$
  \ker(\alpha) = \Set{g\in G | \alpha(g) = e}
$$

Where $e$ is the identity element of $G'$. It follows immediately from this definition that $\alpha$ is injective if and only if $\ker(\alpha) = \Set{e}$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $\ker{\alpha} = \Set{e}$, then

$$
\begin{align*}
  &\alpha(g) = \alpha(g') \implies \alpha(g^{-1} g') = e
  \implies& g^{-1} g' = e \implies g = g'
\end{align*}
$$

showing that $\alpha$ is injective. The converse is obvious.

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-14'>
The kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The kernel of a homomorphism is obviously a subgroup. If $a \in\ker(\alpha)$, so that $\alpha(a) = e$, and $g\in G$, then

$$
  \alpha(gag^{-1}) = \alpha(g)\alpha(a)\alpha(g)^{-1} = \alpha(g)\alpha(g)^{-1} = e
$$

Hence $gag^{-1} \in\ker(\alpha)$.

<MathBox title='Quotient group' boxType='definition'>
Let $G$ be a group. The group of cosets of a normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ is called the *quotient/factor group* of $G$ by $N$, and is denoted $G/N$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Normal subgroups are kernels of homomorphisms' boxType='proposition'>
Every normal subgroup occurs as the kernel of a homomorphism. More precisely, if $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then there is a unique group structure on the set $G/N$ of cosets of $N$ in $G$ for which the natural map $a\mapsto [a]: G \to G/N$ is a homomorphism.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Write the cosets as left cosets, and define $(aN)(bN) = (ab)N$. We have to check **(1)** that this is well-defined, and **(2)** that it gives a group structure on the set of cosets. It will then be obvious that the map $g\mapsto gN$ is a homomorphism with kernel $N$.
1. Let $aN = a'N$ and $bN = b'N$. We have to show that $abN = a'b'N$. However, by proposition

$$
  abN = a(bN) = a(b'N) = aNb' = a'Nb' = a'b'N
$$
2. The product is certainly associate, the coset $N$ is an identity element, and $a^{-1} N$ is an inverse for $aN$.

<MathBox title='Universal property of quotient groups' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-16'>
The map $a\mapsto aN: G\to G/N$ has the following universal property: for any homomorphism $\alpha:G\to G'$ of groups such that $\alpha(N) = \Set{e}$, there exists a unique homomorphism $G/N \to G'$ making the following diagram commute.

Note that for $n\in N$, we have $\alpha(gn) = \alpha(g)\alpha(n) = \alpha(g)$, and so $\alpha$ is constant on each left coset $gN$ of $N$ in $G$. It therefore defines a map $\bar{\alpha}: G/N \to G'$ by $\bar{\alpha}(gN) = \alpha(g)$, which is a homomorphism because

$$
\begin{align*}
  \bar{\alpha}((gN)\cdot(g'N)) =& \bar{\alpha}(gg'N) = \alpha(gg') \\
  =& \alpha(g)\alpha(g') = \bar{\alpha}(gN)\bar{\alpha}(g'N)
\end{align*}
$$

The uniqueness of $\bar{\alpha}$ follows from the surjectivity of $G\to G/N$.

## Homomorphism/isomorphism theorems

<MathBox title='Homomorphism theorem' boxType='theorem' tag='theorem-2'>
For any group homomorphism $\alpha:G\to G'$, the kernel $N$ of $\alpha$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, the image $I$ of $\alpha$ is a subgroup of $G'$ and $\alpha$ factors in a natural way into the composite of a surjection, an isomorphism, and an injection

$$
\begin{CD}
  G @>{\alpha}>> G' \\
  @V{g\mapsto gn}V{\text{surjective}}V @AA{\text{injective}}A \\
  G/N @>{gN \mapsto \alpha(g)}>{\text{isomorphism}}> I
\end{CD}
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

By Proposition $\ref{proposition-14}$, the kernel of $\alpha$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. If $b = \alpha(a)$ and $b' = \alpha(a')$, then $bb' = \alpha(aa')$ and $b^{-1} = \alpha(a^{-1})$, and so $I := \alpha(G)$ is a subgroup of $G'$. The universal property of quotients (Proposition $\ref{proposition-16}$) shows that the map $x\mapsto \alpha(x):G\to I$ defines a homomorphism $\bar{\alpha}:G/N\to I$ with $\bar{\alpha}(gN) = \alpha(g)$. The homomorphism $\bar{\alpha}$ is certainly surjective, and if $\bar{\alpha} (gN) = e$, then $g\in\ker(\alpha) = N$. Thus, $\bar{\alpha}$ has a trivial kernel, making it injective.

<MathBox title='Isomorphism theorem' boxType='theorem'>
Let $G$ be a group, $H$ a subgroup of $G$ and $N$ a normal subgroup of $G$. Then $H\cap N$ is normal in $H$ and $H/(H\cap N) \cong NH/N$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

By Proposition $\ref{proposition-13}$, $HN$ is a subgroup. Consider the map $h\mapsto hN: H\to G/N$. This is a homomorphism, and its kernel is $H\cap N$, which is therefore normal in $H$. By Theorem $\ref{theorem-2}$, the map induces an isomorphism $H/(H\cap N) \to I$, where $I$ is its image. However, $I$ is the set of cosets of the form $hN$ with $h\in H$, i.e., $I = HN/N$.

<MathBox title='Correspondence theorem' boxType='theorem' tag='theorem-6'>
Let $\alpha: G\to \bar{G}$ be a surjective homomorphism, and let $N = \ker{\alpha}$. Then there is a bijection

$$
  \Set{\text{subgroup of }G\text{ containing }N} \leftrightarrow {\text{subgroup of }G}
$$

under which a subgroup $H$ of $G$ containing $N$ corresponds to $\bar{H} = \alpha(H)$ and a subgroup $\bar{H}$ of $\bar{G}$ corresponds to $H = \alpha^{-1} (\bar{H})$. Moreover, if $H \cong \bar{H}$ and $H' \cong \bar{H}'$, then
1. $\bar{H} \subset \bar{H}' \iff H \subset H'$, in which case $|\bar{H}': \bar{H}| = |H': H|$
2. $\bar{H}$ is normal in $\bar{G}$ if and only if $H$ is normal in $G$, in which case, $\alpha$ induces an isomorphism
$$
  G/H \cong \bar{G}/\bar{H}
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $\bar{H}$ is a subgroup of $\bar{G}$, then $\alpha^{-1}(\bar{H})$ is easily seen to be a subgroup of $G$ containing $N$, and if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $\alpha(H)$ is a subgroup of $\bar{G}$. Clearly, $\alpha^{-1} \alpha(H) = HN$, which equals $H$ if and only if $H \supset N$, and $\alpha\alpha^{-1} (\bar{H}) = \bar{H}$. Thus, the two operations give the required bijection. The remaining statements are easily verified. For example, a decomposition $H' = \bigsqcup_{i\in I} a_i H$ of $H'$ into a disjoint union of left cosets of $H$ gives a similar decomposition $H' = \bigsqcup_{i\in I} \alpha(a_i) \bar{H}$ of $\bar{H}'$.

## Direct products

<MathBox title='Direct product of group' boxType='definition'>
A group $G$ is a *direct product* of its subgroups $H_1,\dots,H_k$ if the map

$$
  (h_1,\dots,h_k) \mapsto h_1\cdot h_k: H_1 \times\cdots\times H_k \to G
$$

is an isomorphism of groups. This means that each element $g$ of $G$ can be written uniquely in the form $g = h_1\cdots h_k$, and that if $g = h_1\cdots h_k$ and $g' = h'_1 \cdots h_k'$, then

$$
  gg' = (h_1 h'_1)\cdots(h_k h'_k)
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Criteria for direct products of groups' boxType='proposition'>
A group $G$ is a direct product of subgroups $H_1$ and $H_2$ if and only if
1. $G = H_1 H_2$
2. $H_1 \cap H_2 = \Set{e}$
3. $h_1 h_2 = h_2 h_1$ for all $h_1 \in H_1$ and $h_2 \in H_2$
4. $H_1 \unlhd G$ and $H_2 \unlhd G$ 

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

If $G$ is the direct product of $H_1$ and $H_2$, then certainly **(1)** and **(3)** hold, and **(2)** holds because, for any $g\in H_1 \cap H_2$, the element $(g, g^{-1})$ maps to $e$ under $(h_1, h_2) \mapsto h_1 h_2$ and so equals $(e,e)$.

Conversely, **(3)** implies that $(h_1, h_2)\mapsto h_1 h_2$ is a homomorphism, and **(2)** implies that it is injective

$$
  h_1 h_2 = e \mapsto h_1 = h_2^{-1} \in H_1 \cap H_2 = \Set{e}
$$

Finally, **(1)** implies that it is injective.

Two elements $h_1, h_2$ of a group commute if and only if their commutator

$$
  [h_1, h_2] := (h_1 h_2)(h_2 h_1)^{-1} = e
$$

However,

$$
  (h_1 h_2)(h_2 h_1)^{-1} = h_1 h_2 h_1^{-1} h_2^{-1} = \begin{cases}
    (h_1 h_2 h_1^{-1})\cdot h_2^{-1} \\
    h_1 \cdot (h_2 h_1^{-1} h_2^{-1})
  \end{cases} 
$$

which is in $H_2$ because $H_2$ is normal, and is in $H_1$ because $H_1$ is normal. Thus, **(2)** implies $[h_1, h_2] = e$.

# Matrix groups

<MathBox title='General linear group' boxType='definition'>
The general linear group of degree $n$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$, denoted $\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$, is the set of all invertible $n\times n$-matrices under matrix multiplication, i.e.

$$
  \mathrm{GL}_n (\R) = \Set{\mathbf{A}\in \mathcal{M}_n (\R) : \det(\mathbf{A}) \neq 0}
$$

When $n\geq 2$, the group $\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ is not Abelian.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

To prove that $\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ is a group for $n\in\N_+$ we need to show that it satisfies the group axioms. Recall that a $n\times n$-matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{F}^{n\times n}$ is invertible if $\det(\mathbf{A}) \neq 0$.

**Closure:** Let $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}\in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ be invertible matrices. Then

$$
  \det(\mathbf{AB}) = \det(\mathbf{A})\det(\mathbf{B}) \neq 0 \implies \mathbf{AB}\in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})
$$

This shows that the matrix product of two invertible matrices is again invertible.

**Associativity:** If $\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B},\mathbf{C}\in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ then by associativity of matrix multiplication

$$
  (\mathbf{AB})\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{BC}) \in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})
$$

**Identity element:** The $n\times n$ identity matrix $\mathbf{I}_n = \mathrm{diag}(1)_{i=1}^n$ is invertible since $det(\mathbf{I}_n) = 1$, implying that $\mathbf{I}_n \in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$. Furthermore, for any $\mathbf{A}\in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ we have

**Inverse element:** Any $\mathbf{A}\in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ is invertible by definition with a unique inverse $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$. Since $\det(\mathbf{A}^{-1}) = \det(\mathbf{A})^{-1} \neq 0$, it follows that $\mathbf{A}^{-1} \in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$. By definition of the matrix inverse we have $\mathbf{AA}^{-1} = \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}_n$.

<MathBox title='Special linear group' boxType='definition'>
The special linear group of degree $n$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$, denoted $\mathrm{SL}_n (\mathbb{F})$, is the set of all invertible $n\times n$ matrices with unit determinant:

$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Unitary group' boxType='definition'>
The unitary group of degree $n$, denoted $\mathrm{U}(n)$, is the set of all complex unitary $n\times n$ matrices, i.e.

$$

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

For $\mathbf{U}\in U(n)$ we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \det(\mathbf{UU}^\dagger) =& \det(\mathbf{U})\det(\mathbf{U}^\dagger) \\
  =& \det(\mathbf{U})\overline{\det(\mathbf{U}^\top)} \\
  =& \det(\mathbf{U})\overline{\det(\mathbf{U})} \\
  =& \det(\mathbf{I}_n) = 1
