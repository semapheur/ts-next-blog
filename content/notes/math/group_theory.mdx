# Group 

<MathBox title='Group' boxType='definition'>
A group is a non-empty set $G$ and a binary operation $*: G \times G \to G$, written as the pair $(G, *)$, with the properties
- $a, b\in G \implies a * b \in G$ **(closure)**
- $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c) \in G, \; \forall a,b,c\in\mathbb{G}$ **(associativity)**
- $\exists e\in G : a * e = e * a = a, \; \forall a\in G$ **(existence of an identity/neutral element)**
- $\forall a\in G,\; \exists g^{-1}\in G : g * g^{-1} = e$ **(existence of inverse elements)**

A group $(G, *)$ is *Abelian* or *commutative* if $*$ also satisfies 
- $a * b = b * a$ for all $a,b \in G$ **(commutativity)** 

Note that the closure property follows implicitly from the definition $*: G \times G \to G$, and is thus sometimes not stated as a property. The group operation is usually referred to as *(group) multiplication*, in which case the operation of two group elements is called a *product*. The group operation $*$ is also usually denoted by $\circ$ or $\cdot$. To simplify notation, it is common to omit the group operation symbol.

If the group operation is addition, the group is called *additive* and the inverse of $a$ is the negative $-a$. Similarly, if the group operation is multiplication, the group is called *multiplicative* and the inverse of $a$ is denoted $a^{-1}$.

The existence of inverse elements implies that the cancellation laws holds in groups

$$
\begin{align*}
  ab =& ac \implies b = c \\
  ba =& ca \implies b = c
\end{align*}
$$

Conversely, if $G$ is finite, cancellation laws imply the existence of inverse elements. The map $G \ni x\mapsto ax \in G$ is injective, and hence bijective by counting. In particular, $e$ is in the image, and so $a$ has a right inverse. Similarly, it has a left inverse, and by uniqueness the two inverses are equal.

<MathBox title='The identity element is its own inverse' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-1'>
If $(G, *)$ is a group with identity element $e$ and $a\in G$, then $a*a = a$ implies $a = e$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $b\in G$ be such that $b*a = e$. Then $b*(a*a) = b*a$ and thus

$$
  a = e*a = (b*a)*a = b*(a*a) = b*a = e
$$
</details>

<MathBox title='Uniqueness of identity and inverses' boxType='definition'>
Let $(G, *)$ be a group with identity element $e$. Then for $a,b\in G$
1. If $b*a = e$, then $a*b = e$
2. For all $a\in G$ there is a unique $e$ such that $a*e = a$
3. For all $a\in G$ there is a unique $b\in G$ such that $b*a = e$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

**(1):** Suppose $b*a = e$, then

$$
  (a*b)*(a*b) = a*(b*a)*b = a*e*b = a*b
$$

By Proposition $\ref{proposition-1}$, it follows that $a*e = e$.

**(2):** Suppose $a\in G$ and Ã¸et $b\in G$ be such that $b*a = e$. By **(1)**, we have

$$
  a*e = a*(b*a) = (a*b) * a = e*a = a
$$

To show uniqueness, suppose $a*e = a$ and $a*f = a$ for all $a*G$. Then

$$
  (e*f)*(e*f) = e*(f*e)*f = e*f*e = e*f
$$

Proposition $\ref{proposition-1}$ implies that $e*f = e$. Thus

$$
  f*f = (f*e)*(f*e) = f*(e*f)*e = f*e*e = f*e = f
$$

Again from Proposition $\ref{proposition-1}$ it follows that $f = e$.

**(3):** Suppose $b_1 * a = e$ and $b_2 * a = e$. Then by **(1)** and **(2)**

$$
  b_1 = b_1 * e = b_1 * (a*b_2) = (b_1 * a) * b_2 = e*b_2 = b_2
$$

<MathBox title='Group isomorphism' boxType='definition'>
Two groups $(G, *)$ and $(H,\ocirc)$ are *isomorphic* if there is a bijection $\theta:H\to G$ such that

$$
  \theta(a * b) = \theta(a) \circ\theta(b),\; \forall a,b\in G
$$

The mapping $\theta$ is called an *isomorphism* and we say that $G$ is isomorphic to $H$, denoted $G \cong H$. If $\theta$ is not bijective, it is called a *homomorphism*. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Group order' boxType='definition'>
The *order* $|G|$ of a group $G$ is its cardinality. A finite group whose order is a power of a prime $p$ is called a *p*-group. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Group element order' boxType='definition'>
For an element $a$ of a group $(G, *)$, define
- $a^n = \underbrace{a * \cdots * a}_{n \text{ times}}$
- $a^{-n} = (a^{-1})^n = \underbrace{a^{-1} * \cdots * a^{-1}}_{n \text{ times}}$
- $a^0 = e$

With the exponentiation rules for all $m, n\in\Z$

$$
\begin{align*}
  a^m a^n =& a^{m+n} \\
  (a^m)^n = a^{mn}
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that the set

$$
  \Set{n\in\Z | a^n = e}
$$

is an ideal in $\Z$, and so equals $m\Z$ for $m\in\N$. When $m = 0$, then $a^n \neq e$ unless $n \neq 0$, and $a$ is said to have *infinite order*. When $m \neq 0$, it is the smallest integer $m > 0$ such that $a^m = e$, and $a$ is said to have *finite order* $n$. In this case, $a^{-1} = a^{m-1}$, and

$$
  a^n = e \iff m|n
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Integers' boxType='example'>
The set of integers $\Z = \Set{ n }_{n=-\infty}^\infty$ with standard addition forms an infinite discrete Abelian group. In this group, the identity element is $e = 0$, while the inverse elements are $g^{-1} = -g$ for all $g\in\Z$. This group can be restricted to the finite cyclic groups $\Z_n$ of order $n\in\N$, where the binary operation is addition modulo $n$. The cyclic groups have the same identity element $e = 0$, but the inverse elements are $g^{-1} = n - g$ for all $g\in\Z_n$.

The simplest non-trivial case is $\Z_2 = \Set{0,1}$ with three possibilities of addition

$$
  0 + 0 = 0,\quad 0 + 1 = 1,\quad 1 + 1 = 0
$$

Defining the bijections $0 \leftrightarrow 1$ and $1 \leftrightarrow -1$, the group $\Z_2$ is isomorphic to the group $G = \Set{-1, 1}$ equipped with standard multiplication and identity element $e = 1$. The latter group $G$ has three possibilities of multiplication

$$
  1\cdot 1 = 1,\quad 1\cdot (-1) = -1,\quad (-1)\cdot(-1) = 1
$$

In general, $\Z_n$ is isomorphic to the group forming the $n$-th roots of unity, $G = \Set{e^{2\pi i k/n} | k=1,\dots,n-1}$, equipped with standard multiplication.

## Subgroups

<MathBox title='Subgroup' boxType='definition'>
Let $(G, *)$ be a group. A nonempty subset $H \subseteq G$ is a *subgroup* of $G$ if $H$ is a group under the binary operation $*:G\times G$. This is commonly denoted $H \leq G$. If $H \subset G$, then $H$ is a *proper subgroup* of $G$, written $H < G$. 
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Subgroup criterion' boxType='proposition' tag='proposition-2'>
Let $(G, *)$ be a group. A subset $H \subseteq G$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if
1. $a,b\in H \implies a*b \in H$ **(closure)**
2. $a\in H \implies a^{-1} \in H$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

By **(1)**, the binary operation on $G$ defines a restriction $*|_H :H\times H \to H$ on $H$, which is inherently associative. By assumption, $H$ contains at least one element $a$, its inverse $a^{-1}$, and the product $aa^{-1}$. By **(2)**, the inverse of elements in $H$ lie in $H$. 
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Intersection of subgroups' boxType='proposition'>
An intersection of subgroups of $G$ is a subgroup of $G$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

An intersection of subgroups of $G$ is nonempty and contains $e$, and the subgroup criterion obviously holds (Proposition $\ref{proposition-2}$).
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='The center is a subgroup' boxType='proposition'>
The centre of a group $G$ is the subset

$$
  Z(G) = \Set{g\in G | gx = xg,\;\forall x\in G}
$$

It is a subgroup of $G$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Since $ge = eg = g$, it follows that $e \in Z(G)$ and $Z(G)\neq\emptyset$. For any $x,y \in Z(G)$, giving $gx = xg$ and $gy = yg$. Applying the group operation yields $(xy)g = x(yg) = x(gy) = (xg)y = (gx)y = g(xy)$, showing that $xy\in Z(G)$. For $x\in Z(G)$, we have $x^{-1} g = x^{-1} (ge) = x^{-1} (gx)x^{-1} = x^{-1} (xg) x^{-1} = (x^{-1}x)gx^{-1} = (eg)x^{-1} = gx^{-1}$, showing that $x^{-1} \in Z(G)$. Hence, $Z(G)$ is a subgroup.

</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Torsion subgroup' boxType='definition'>
If $G$ is an Abelian group, the elements finite order form a subgroup $G_T$ of $G$, called the *torsion subgroup*.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Existence of smallest subgroups' boxType='proposition'>
For any subset $H$ of a group $G$, there is a smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $H$. It consists of all finite products of elements of $H$ and their inverses (repetitions allowed).

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

The intersection $S$ of all subgroups of $G$ containing $H$ is again a subgroup containing $H$, and is evidently the smallest such group. Clearly, $S$ contains all finite products of elements of $H$ and their inverses. Since $H$ is a subgroup, the set of such products satisfies Proposition $\ref{proposition-2}$, and hence is a subgroup containing $H$. It therefore equals $S$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Generated subgroup' boxType='definition'>
If $G$ is a group with subset $H \subseteq G$, the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $H$ is denoted $\langle H\rangle$ and is called the *subgroup generated* by $H$. We also say that $H$ *generates* \langle H\rangle.
</MathBox>

### Cyclic groups

<MathBox title='Division algorithm' boxType='theorem' tag='theorem-1'>
Let $m\in\Z$ and $d\in\N_+$. Then there exists unique integers $q$ (quotient) and $r$ (remainder) such that

$$
  m = dq + r,\; 0\leq r < d
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

To prove existence of $q$ and $r$, consider the set of remainders $S =: \Set{m - qd | q\in\Z \land m - qd \geq 0}$. To show that $S$ is not empty, consider the two cases 
- if $m \geq 0$, then for $q = 0$, we have $a - 0\cdot d = a \in S$. 
- if $m < 0$ then for $q = m$ we have $0 \leq m - md = m(1 - d)\in S$ since $1 - d \leq 0$
Thus, $S$ is nonempty and by the well-ordering principle, $S$ has a least element, say $r = m - qd \geq 0$. Next, we show that $r < d$ by contradiction. Assuming $r \geq d$, we have $r - d \geq 0$. Since $r = m - qd$, we have

$$
  0 \leq r - d = m - qd - d = m - (q + 1)d \in S
$$

However, $m - (q + 1)d < r$ contradicting the fact that $r$ is the least element of $S$. This proves the existence of integers $q$ and $r$ with $0 \leq r < d$ such that $m = qd + r$.

To prove uniqueness, suppose there exists another pair of integers $q'$ and $r'$ such that $0 \leq r' < d$ and $m = q'd + r'$. Assuming $r \geq r'$ (the converse case is analogous), we have $r - r' \geq 0$. Since $m = qd + r = q'd + r'$ we know that $q'd - qd = r - r'$. However, $0 \leq r - r'$ so $0 \leq (q' - q)d < d$. This implies that $0 \leq q' - q < 1$. Since $q' - q$ is an integer, it follows that $q' - q = 0$ and $q' = q$. Then $r = m - qd = m - q'd = r'$.

<MathBox title='Cyclic group' boxType='definition'>
Let $G$ be a group. The subgroup generated by all integers powers of an element $g$, i.e.

$$
  \langle g \rangle = \Set{g^n | n\in\Z}
$$

is called the *cyclic subgroup* generated by $g$. The order of $g$ is $|\langle g\rangle|$, the number of elements in $\langle g\rangle$. A group $G$ is *cyclic* if it is generated by a single element, i.e. if $G = \langle g \rangle$ for some $g\in G$. 

A *finite cyclic group* $G$ of order $n$, denoted $C_n$, is the set

$$
  C_n = G = \Set{e,g,g^2,\dots,g^{n-1}},\quad g^i = g^j \iff i \equiv j \mod n
$$

In particular $g^0 = g^n = e$ and $g^{-1} = g^{n-1}$. Such a group is isomorphic to $(\Z_n = \Z/n\Z, +)$ under the bijection $g^i \mapsto i$.

An *infinite cyclic group* $G$, denoted $C_\infty$, is the set

$$
  C_\infty = G = \Set{\dots, r^{-i},\dots,r^{-1},e,r,\dots,r^i,\dots}
$$

which is isomorphic to $(\Z,+)$.
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Subgroups of cyclic groups a cyclic' boxType='proposition-3'>
Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Let $G = \langle g \rangle$ be a cyclic group for $g\in G$, and suppose $H \leq G$. If $H = \Set{1}$, then $H = \langle 1 \rangle$. Otherwise there is a smallest positive integer $d\in\N_+$ such that $g^d \in H$. We will show that $H = \langle g^d \rangle$. Let $h\in H$. Then $h = g^m$ for some integer $m\in\Z$. Applying the division algorithm (Theorem $\ref{theorem-1}$), we find integers $q$ and $r$ such that

$$
  m = dq + r,\; 0\leq r < d
$$

Then

$$
  h = g^m = g^{dq + r} = g^{dq} g^r = (g^d)^q g^r
$$

Hence $g^r = (a^d)^{-q} h \in H$. However, $0 \leq r < d$, and since $d$ is the smallest positive integer such that $g^d \in H$, we must have $r = 0$. Hence, $h = g^m = g^{dq} = (g^d)^q \in \langle g^d \rangle = H$.
</details>
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='' boxType='proposition'>
Let $G = \langle g \rangle$ be a cyclic group of order $n$. For each $k$ dividing $n$, $G$ has a unique subgroup of order $k$, i.e. $\langle g^{n/k} \rangle$.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Assuming $t = \frac{n}{k}$, it is easy to see that $\langle g^t \rangle$ is a subgroup of order $k$. Let $H$ be any subgroup of $G$ or order $k$. Then by the proof of Proposition $\ref{proposition-3}$, we have $H = \langle g^d \rangle$, where $d\in\N_+$ is the smallest positive integer such that $g^d \in H$. Applying the division algorithm (Theorem $\ref{theorem-1}$), we obtaing integers $q$ and $r$ such that

$$
  n = dq + r,\; 0 \leq r < d
$$

Thus, $1 = g^n = g^{dq + r} = (g^d)^q g^r$ and so $g^r = (g^d)^{-q} \in H$. Consequently, $r = 0$ and so $n = dq$. Also $k = |H| = |\langle g^d\rangle| = q = \frac{n}{d}$. Thus, $d = \frac{n}{k} = t$, i.e. $H = \langle g^d\rangle = \rangle g^t \rangle$.

## Matrix groups

<MathBox title='General linear group' boxType='definition'>
The general linear group of degree $n$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$, denoted $\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$, is the set of all invertible $n\times n$-matrices under matrix multiplication, i.e.

$$
  \mathrm{GL}_n (\R) = \Set{\mathbf{A}\in \mathcal{M}_n (\R) : \det(\mathbf{A}) \neq 0}
$$

When $n\geq 2$, the group $\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ is not Abelian.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

To prove that $\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ is a group for $n\in\N_+$ we need to show that it satisfies the group axioms. Recall that a $n\times n$-matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{F}^{n\times n}$ is invertible if $\det(\mathbf{A}) \neq 0$.

**Closure:** Let $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}\in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ be invertible matrices. Then

$$
  \det(\mathbf{AB}) = \det(\mathbf{A})\det(\mathbf{B}) \neq 0 \implies \mathbf{AB}\in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})
$$

This shows that the matrix product of two invertible matrices is again invertible.

**Associativity:** If $\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B},\mathbf{C}\in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ then by associativity of matrix multiplication

$$
  (\mathbf{AB})\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{BC}) \in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})
$$

**Identity element:** The $n\times n$ identity matrix $\mathbf{I}_n = \mathrm{diag}(1)_{i=1}^n$ is invertible since $det(\mathbf{I}_n) = 1$, implying that $\mathbf{I}_n \in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$. Furthermore, for any $\mathbf{A}\in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ we have

**Inverse element:** Any $\mathbf{A}\in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$ is invertible by definition with a unique inverse $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$. Since $\det(\mathbf{A}^{-1}) = \det(\mathbf{A})^{-1} \neq 0$, it follows that $\mathbf{A}^{-1} \in\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{F})$. By definition of the matrix inverse we have $\mathbf{AA}^{-1} = \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}_n$.
</details>

<MathBox title='Special linear group' boxType='definition'>
The special linear group of degree $n$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$, denoted $\mathrm{SL}_n (\mathbb{F})$, is the set of all invertible $n\times n$ matrices with unit determinant:

$$
  \mathrm{SL}_n (\R) = \Set{\mathbf{A}\in \mathrm{GL}_n (\R) : \det(\mathbf{A}) = 1}
$$
</MathBox>

<MathBox title='Unitary group' boxType='definition'>
The unitary group of degree $n$, denoted $\mathrm{U}(n)$, is the set of all complex unitary $n\times n$ matrices, i.e.

$$
  \mathrm{U}(n) = \Set{\mathbf{A}\in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{C}) : \mathbf{AA}^\dagger = \mathbf{I}_n}
$$

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

For $\mathbf{U}\in U(n)$ we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  \det(\mathbf{UU}^\dagger) =& \det(\mathbf{U})\det(\mathbf{U}^\dagger) \\
  =& \det(\mathbf{U})\overline{\det(\mathbf{U}^\top)} \\
  =& \det(\mathbf{U})\overline{\det(\mathbf{U})} \\
  =& \det(\mathbf{I}_n) = 1
\end{align*}
$$

showing that $\det(\mathbf{U}) = e^{i\theta}$.

<MathBox title='Orthogonal group' boxType='definition'>
The orthogonal group of degree $n$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$, denoted $\mathrm{SL}_n (\mathbb{F})$, is the set of all invertible $n\times n$ matrices with unit determinant:

$$
  \mathrm{SL}_n (\R) = \Set{\mathbf{A}\in \mathrm{GL}_n (\R) : \det(\mathbf{A}) = 1}
$$
