# Interest rate

Interest is the cost of borrowing money paid in fixed amounts on a fixed schedule over the lending period. Interest rate is the amount of interest due per period, as a proportion of the remaining amount of borrowed money, called the principal. 

Interest is classified as *simple* or *compound*. Simple interest is calculated only on the remaining principal, while compound interest also includes interest earned on previously accumulated interest.

Interest rate is usually stated on an annualized term either as a *nominal* or *effective* rate. Nominal interest rate (also called coupon rate) is the stated annual interest without accounting for compounding effects. Effective interest rate is the true interest rate accounting for compounding effects.

Consider a pure discount (zero-coupon) bond with price given by $P:[0,\infty)\to\R$. Suppose the bond is bought at time $t$ and matures at time $T$. The interest of the bond is the value $r\in\R$ that solves

$$
  P(t)(1 + r) = P(T) \iff r = \frac{P(T) - P(t)}{P(t)}
$$

If $f\in\R$ is the annualized compounding frequency, and $r$ is the annual nominal rate, the effective rate is given by  

$$
  1 + R = \left(1 + \frac{r}{f} \right)^f \iff R = \left(1 + \frac{r}{f} \right)^f - 1
$$
c
The *continuously compunded interest rate* is the rate paid at infinite frequency

$$
  1 + R = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1 + \frac{r}{f}\right)^f = e^r
$$

## Present value

Present value is the current value of expected income payments. Consider a time interval $[0,T]$ consisting of $n$ equally spaced periods, with interest rate $r$ per period. Suppose that we receive a payment $P_t$ at time $t\in[0,T]$. The compounded future value of the cash flow is

$$
  P(T) = \sum_{i=0}^m P_i (1 + r)^{m - i}
$$

The present value of the cash flows is

$$
  V(0) = \sum_{i=0}^m \frac{V_i}{(1 + r)^{m-i}} = \frac{V(T)}{(1 + r)^m}
$$

where $d = \frac{1}{1 + r}$ is called the *discount factor*.

Recall the summation formula for a geometric sequence

$$
  \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{1}{(1 + r)^m} = \frac{1}{r}\left(1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^m} \right)
$$

If the cash flow consists of equal payments $P$, the present value takes the form 

$$
  V(0) = \frac{P}{r}\left(1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^m} \right)
$$

Solving for $P$ we get

$$
  P = \frac{r(1 + r)^m V(0)}{(1 + r)^m - 1}
$$

## Bond yield

The *yield*, or *internal rate of return* (IRR) of a bond is the interest rate value for which the present value of the bond's payments (the coupons and the face value) equals the current bond price.

Let $V$ be the face value of a bond with $n$ coupon payments per year at regular intervals, each of size $C/n$. Suppose that there are $T$ years left until maturity, for a total of $T\cdot n = m$ periods until maturity. If $y(t)$ is the yield, the bond price is given by

$$
  P(t) = \frac{V}{(1 + y(t))^T} + \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{C/n}{(1 + y(t))^{i/n}}
$$

This shows that the price and yield of the bond are inversely related; higher yield implies lower price and vice versa, because paying less for a bond today means getting a higher return later.
