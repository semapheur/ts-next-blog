# Hurst exponent

<MathBox title='Stochastic process with long-term memory' boxType="definition">
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ be a probability space. Suppose $X_t: \Omega\times\R \to\R$ is a stationary stochastic process with autocorrelation function $\rho: \N\to [-1,1]$. If there exists a real number $\alpha\in (0,1)$ and a constant $c_\rho > 0$ such that the $\rho$ satisfy the asymptotic relation

$$
  \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{\rho(k)}{c_\rho k^{-\alpha}} = 1
$$

then $X_t$ is called a stationary process with long-term memory (or long-range dependence). This means that the autocorrelations decay according to a power law with a non-integrable tail:

$$
  \sum_{k=1}^\infty \rho(k) = \infty
$$
</MathBox>

The slow decay of the autocorrelation function in a time series with long-range dependence implies that observations remain significantly correlated even at large time lags. In contrast, a process with short-range dependence exhibits autocorrelations that decay exponentially fast to zero as the lag increases, meaning that correlations between distant observations are negligible.

<MathBox title='Self-similar stochastic process' boxType="definition">
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ be a probability space. A stochastic process $X_t: \Omega\times\R \to\R$ is self-similar (or self-affine) with Hurst exponent $H\in [0,1]$ if

$$
  X(t) \sim \lambda^{-H} X(\lambda t)\quad\forall \lambda < 0
$$

where $\sim$ denotes equality in distribution. The Hurst exponent $H$ expresses the tendency for increments $\d X = \frac{\d X(t)}{\d t}\d t$ to change sign:
- When $H = \frac{1}{2}$, increments are uncorrelated and the sign changes randomly. This corresponds to a standard Wiener process (geometric Brownian motion).
- When $\frac{1}{2}< H\leq 1$, the increments tend to persist in the same direction. This behaviour is called persistence.
- When $0\leq H < \frac{1}{2}$, the increments tend to switch sign more frequently. This is known as anti-persistence (or negative autocorrelation)

The unconditional moments of $X_t$, if they exist, behave as power laws of time

$$
  \mathrm{E}\left[ |X(t) | \right]^q = \mathrm{E}\left[ |X(1)|^q \right]|t|^{qH}
$$

Moreover, the Hurst exponent is related to the fractal dimension $D$ of the graph of $X_t$ via the identity

$$
  D + H = 2
$$
</MathBox>

## Estimation methods

Estimation methods for the Hurst exponent can be broadly categorized into two main groups:
1. Sequence representation methods ocus on how the time series is structured or transformed to reveal scaling behavior. They can be further divided into:
    - Time-domain methods, which analyze the time series directly. The Hurst exponent is estimated by examining how certain statistical properties (e.g., rescaled range or variance) change with varying observation periods.
    - Frequency-domain (spectrum-domain) methods, which apply transformations such as the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) or Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to the time series, enabling analysis in the spectral domain.
2. Parameter estimation methods aim to fit statistical models to the data in order to estimate the Hurst exponent. They include:
    - Linear regression techniques
    - Bayesian methods, which incorporate prior knowledge and probabilistic inference to estimate the Hurst exponent in a more flexible and robust manner.

### Rescaled range analysis

Let $\set{X_i}_{i=1}^n$ be a sample of stochastic process $X_t$ with mean 

$$
  \bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i
$$

The range of $X_t$ up to time $n$, denoted $R(n)$, is defined as

$$
  R(n) = \max_{1\leq t\leq n} Z_t - \min_{1\leq t\leq n} Z_t
$$

where $Z_t$ is the cumulative deviation from the mean, given by 

$$
  Z_t = \sum_{i=1}^t X_i - \bar{X} 
$$

Here $Y_i = X_i - \bar{X}$, is the mean-adjusted series, and $Z_t$ represents the accumulated deviation from the mean up to time $t$.

The rescaled range statistic, denoted $R(n)/S(n)$ normalizes the cumulative range $R(n)$ by the standard deviation of the process, given by

$$
  S(n) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2}
$$

The Hurst exponent $H\in (0,1)$ is defined in terms of the asymptotic behaviour of the expected rescaled range as a function of the time span $n$. If the underlying process $X_t$ exhibits long-range dependence, the rescaled range grows exponentially like a power law:

$$
  \lim_{n\to\infty} \mathrm{E}\left[ \frac{R(n)}{S(n)} \right] = Cn^H
$$

where $C > 0$ is a constant.

Rescaled range analysis estimates the Hurst exponent $H$ by quantifying the scaling behaviour of fluctuations in a time series acrros multiple time scales. The method proceeds as follows:

1. **Segment the series**

Given a time series $\set{X_i}_{i=1}^N$, choose a minimal segment size $w\in\N_+$. Let $N' \leq N$ be the largest number such that such that $N' = mk$, where
- $m\in S_\text{bpf} (N',w) = \set{m_j}_{j=1}^n$ is a bounded proper factor of $N'$, satisfying $m \geq w$
- $k = N'/m \in\N_+$ is the number of non-overlapping segments of size $m$
- $n = |S_\text{bpf} (N', w)|$ is the number of valid segment lengths considered

2. **Construct the cumulative deviation series**

For each segment:
- Calculate the sample mean $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ 
- Form the mean-adjusted series $Y_t = X_t - \bar{X}$ for $1 \leq t \leq m$.
- Compute the cumulative deviate series $Z_t = \sum_{i=1}^t Y_i$.

3. **Compute the rescaled range**

For each segment:
- Compute the range $R(n, \tau) = \max_{1\leq i\leq m} Z_i - \min_{1\leq i\leq m} Z_i$ 
- Compute the standard deviation $S(n, \tau) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(X_i - \bar{X}\right)^2}$
- Calculate the rescaled range $\operatorname{RS}(m, \tau) = R(m,\tau)/S(m,\tau)$

Average over all $k$ segments of size $m$ to obtain the mean rescaled range

$$
  \widebar{\operatorname{RS}}(m) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{\tau=1}^k \frac{R(m,\tau)}{S(m,\tau)}
$$

4. **Estimate the Hurst exponent**

By repeating the above steps over a range of segment sizes $m \in S_\text{bpf} (N', w)$, the rescaled range $\widebar{\operatorname{RS}}(m, \tau)$ is expected to scale asymptotically as a power-law:

$$
  \widebar{\operatorname{RS}}(m, \tau) \propto m^H \iff \ln[\widebar{\operatorname{RS}}(m, \tau)] \sim \gamma + H \ln(m)
$$

The Hurst exponent $H$ is estimated as the slope of the linear regression of $\ln[\widebar{\operatorname{RS}}(m, \tau)]$ against $\ln(m)$.

Generalized Hurst exponent for a time series $x(t)$

$$
  \langle \left| g(t + \tau) - g(t) \right|^q \rangle_t \sim \tau^{qH(q)}
$$

### Moment-based estimators

Another method for estimating the global Hurst exponent utilizes absolute moments of a Gaussian random variable. Assuming that we have $N$ observations of an MBM with equal spacing in time, the $k$-th moment in window of size $\epsilon_N \leq N$ is given by

$$
  M_k (t) = \frac{1}{\epsilon_N} \sum_{i=0}^{\epsilon_N - 1} \left| X\left(t - \frac{i}{N} \right) - X\left(t - \frac{i + 1}{N} \right) \right|^k
$$

which is an estimate for $E\left[ \left| X(t) - X\left(t - \frac{1}{N} \right) \right|^k \right]$ given by

$$
  E\left[ \left| X(t) - X\left(t - \frac{1}{N} \right) \right|^k \right] = \frac{2^{k/2}\Gamma\left( \frac{k + 1}{2} \right)}{\Gamma\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)}\sigma^k N^{-kH(t)}
$$

This leads to the following estimate of $H(t)$

$$
  \hat{H}(t) = -\frac{\ln\left[ \sqrt{\pi}M_k (t) \right] - \ln\left[ 2^{k/2} \Gamma\left( \frac{k + 1}{2} \right)\sigma^k \right]}{k \ln(N)}
$$

which converges towards $H(t)$ at the rate $O\left[ \left( \sqrt{\epsilon_N} \ln(N) \right)^{-1}\right]$. For $k = 1$, the estimator becomes

$$
  \hat{H}(t) = -\frac{\ln\left( \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{M_1 (t)}{\sigma} \right)}{\ln(N)}
$$

To get rid of the parameter $\sigma$, the ratio of two moments can be calculated for observations in a common window at different resolutions. For $k = 2$, the average quadratic variation $M_2 (t)$ can be compared with a statistic $M'_2 (t)$ with halved resolution

$$
  M'_2 (t) = \frac{2}{\epsilon_N} \sum_{i=0}^{\epsilon_N / 2 - 1} \left| X\left( t - \frac{2i}{N} \right) - X\left( t - \frac{2(i + 1)}{N} \right) \right|^2
$$

The ratio $M'_2(t)/M_2(t)$ converges towards $2^{2H(t)}$, resulting in the estimator

$$
  \hat{H}(t) = \frac{1}{2}\log_2 \left( \frac{M'_2 (t)}{M_2 (t)} \right)
$$

Estimators can be derived from more general filters

$$
  V^a_{t, i} (X) = \frac{j+1}{d} a_j X\left( t - \frac{i + j - 1}{N} \right)
$$

The moment-based approach is retrieved for $a = (1, -1)$.

### Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)

Detrended fluctuation analysis is a method used to estimate the Hurst exponent of a time series, particularly effective for detecting long-range correlations in non-stationary signals. The procedure is as follows:

1. **Segment the series**

Given a time series $\set{X_i}_{i=1}^N$, choose a minimal segment size $w\in\N_+$. Let $N' \leq N$ be the largest number such that such that $N' = mk$, where
- $m\in S_\text{bpf} (N',w) = \set{m_j}_{j=1}^n$ is a bounded proper factor of $N'$, satisfying $m \geq w$
- $k = N'/m \in\N_+$ is the number of non-overlapping segments of size $m$
- $n = |S_\text{bpf} (N', w)|$ is the number of valid segment lengths considered

2. **Construct the cumulative deviation series**

Compute the mean of the truncated seires

$$
  \bar{X} = \frac{1}{N'} \sum_{i=1}^{N'} X_i
$$

Then form the cumulative deviation series

$$
  Z_t = \sum_{j=1}^t X_j - \bar{X},\; 1\leq t\leq N'
$$

3. **Divide into non-overlapping segments**

Partition $Z_t$ into the $k = N'/m$ non-overlapping segments of length $m$. For each segment $\tau = 1,\dots,k$ define

$$
  \mathbf{Y}_\tau = [Z_{(\tau - 1)m+1},Z_{(\tau - 1)m+2}\dots,Z_{\tau m}]^\top,\; 1\leq\tau\leq k
$$

4. **Fit and detrend each segment**

For each seqment $\mathbf{Y}_\tau$, perform a linear least squares regression

$$
  \hat{Z}_{i,\tau} = \alpha_\tau + \beta_\tau i,\; 1\leq i \leq m
$$

Compute the residuals (detrended signal):

$$
  \varepsilon_{i, \tau} = Z_{(\tau-1)m + i} - \hat{Z}_{i,\tau}
$$

5. **Calculate detrended fluctuation**

Compute the root-mean-square deviation (local fluctuation) for each segment:

$$
  F(m, \tau) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=\tau m + 1}^{jm + m} (X_i - Y_{i, \tau})}
$$

Average the local fluctuations over all segments:

$$
  F(m) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{k} \sum_{\tau=1}^k F(m, \tau)^2}
$$

6. **Estimate asymptotic behaviour**

By repeating the above steps over a range of segment sizes $m \in S_\text{bpf} (N', w)$, the fluctuation function $F(m)$ is expected to scale asymptotically as a power-law

$$
  F(m) \propto m^\alpha \iff \ln[F(m)] \sim \gamma + \alpha \ln(m)
$$

where the scaling exponent $\alpha$ is a generalization of the Hurst exponent. The exponent $\alpha$ is estimated as the slope of the linear regression of $\ln[F(m)]$ against $\ln(m)$, and describes trends about the series auto-correlation:
- $\alpha < 1/2$: anti-correlated
- $\alpha = 1/2$: uncorrelated (white noise)
- $\alpha > 1/2$: correlated
- $\alpha = 1$: $1/f$-noise (pink noise)
- $\alpha > 1$: non-station, unbounded
- $\alpha = 3/2$: Brownian noise 

#### Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MDFA)

Multifractal detrended flucutation analysis generalizes (DFA) by computing $q$-th order detrended fluctuation function:

$$
  F_q (m) = \left(\frac{1}{k} \sum_{\tau=1}^k F(m, \tau)^q \right)^{1/q},\; q\in\R\setminus\set{0}
$$

Multifractal time series exhibits the power-law scaling relation

$$
  F_q (m) \propto m^{\alpha(q)}
$$

where $\alpha(q)$ is the generalized Hurst exponent, which depends on $q$. The classical DFA corresponds to the special case $q = 2$.

### Averaged wavelet coefficient method

Applying the wavelet transform to a self-similar stochastic process $X(t)$ gives

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{W}\left[ X(t) \right](a, b) &\simeq \mathcal{W}\left[ \lambda^{-H} X(\lambda t) \right](a, b) \\
  &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \lambda^{-H} X(\lambda t) \overline{\psi\left( \frac{t - b}{a} \right)}\d t \\
  &= \lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}-H} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda a}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty X(\lambda t') \overline{\psi\left( \frac{t' - \lambda b}{\lambda a} \right)}\d t' \\
  &= \lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}-H} \mathcal{W}\left[ X(t) \right] (\lambda a, \lambda b)
\end{align*}
$$

This shows that if we rescale the wavelet domain with the factor $\lambda$, the wavelet coefficient of the original domain rescales by a factor $\lambda^{\frac{1}{2}+H}$. The average wavelet coefficient at a given scale $a$ can be found by averaging out the translation parameter $b$

$$
  W[X(t)](a) := \langle | \mathcal{W}[X(t)](a, b) | \rangle_b
$$

where $\langle\cdot\rangle_b$ is the arithmic mean operator with respect to the translation parameter $b$. The rescaling relation becomes

$$
  W[X(t)](\lambda a) \simeq \lambda^{\frac{1}{2}+H}W[h](a)
$$

### Variational smoothing

The variational smoothing $\mathcal{H}$ of a noisy parameter $\hat{H}$ aims at minimizing the quadratic distance between $\mathcal{H}$ and $\hat{H}$ 

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{H} =& \argmin_{h \in C^2([0, 1], \R)} \int_0^1 \left[ \left( h(t) - \hat{H}(t) \right)^2 + \lambda h'(t)^2 \right]\d t \\
  =& \argmin_{h \in C^2([0, 1], \R)} \int_0^1 \mathcal{L} \left[ t, h(t), h'(t)\right]\d t
\end{align*}
$$

where $\lambda \geq 0$ is a smoothness factor. The Euler-Lagrange equation becomes

$$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial h}  \mathcal{L} \left[ t, h(t), h'(t)\right] = \frac{\d}{\d}\frac{\partial}{\partial h'} \mathcal{L} \left[ t, h(t), h'(t)\right]
$$

For $\lambda > 0$, we get the second order linear differential equation

$$
  \mathcal{H}''(t) - \frac{\mathcal{H}(t)}{\lambda} = -\frac{\hat{H}(t)}{\lambda}
$$

with the general solution

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{H}(t) =& e^{t/\sqrt{\lambda}} \left( A - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\lambda}} \int_0^t e^{-s/\sqrt{\lambda}} \hat{H}(s) \d s \right) \\
  &+ e^{-t/\sqrt{\lambda}} \left( B + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\lambda}} \int_0^t e^{s/\sqrt{\lambda}} \hat{H}(s) \d s \right)
\end{align*}
$$

The unique solution that minimizes $\int_0^1 \left[ \mathcal{H}(t) - \hat{H}(t) \right]^2 \d t$ is 

$$
  \mathcal{H}(t) = \Phi \hat{H}(t) + Ae^{\frac{t}{\sqrt{\lambda}}} +  Be^{-\frac{t}{\sqrt{\lambda}}}
$$

where the operator $\Phi$ is given by

$$
  \Phi h(t) = \frac{e^{t/\sqrt{\lambda}}}{2\sqrt{\lambda}} \int_0^t e^{-s/\sqrt{\lambda}} h(s) \d s + \frac{e^{-t/\sqrt{\lambda}}}{2\sqrt{\lambda}} \int_0^t e^{s/\sqrt{\lambda}}h(s) \d s
$$

and where 

$$
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{G}(t) &= \hat{H} - \Phi\hat{H}(t) \\
  C &= \sqrt{\frac{2}{\sqrt{\lambda}\left( e^{2/\sqrt{\lambda} - 1} \right)}} \\
  D &= C\left( e^{-2/\sqrt{\lambda}} - C^4 \right)^{-1/2} \\
  A &= C^2 \left( 1 + C^2 D^2 \right) \int_0^1 \mathcal{G}(s) e^{s/\sqrt{\lambda}}\d s - C^2 D^2 \int_0^1 \mathcal{G}(s) e^{-s/\sqrt{\lambda}}\d s \\
  B &= -C^2 D^2 \int_0^1 \mathcal{G}(s) e^{s/\sqrt{\lambda}}\d s + D^2 \int_0^1 \mathcal{G}(s) e^{-s/\sqrt{\lambda}}\d s
\end{align*}
$$

When $\lambda$ is close to zero, the exponentials in the closed form of $\mathcal{H}$ blow up, giving inaccuracies in the discrete approximation of the integrals for the coefficients $A$ and $B$. In a discrete framework the coefficients can be calculted using least-squares regression

$$
\begin{align*}
  A &= \frac{1}{\left( \sum_{i=1}^n e^{2t_i /\sqrt{\lambda}} \right)\left( \sum_{i=1}^n e^{-2t_i /\sqrt{\lambda}} \right) - n^2} \left[ \left( \sum_{i=1}^n e^{-2t_i /\sqrt{\lambda}} \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n e^{t_i /\sqrt{\lambda}} \left| 1 - \Phi^d \right| \hat{H}(t_i) \right) - n \left( \sum_{i=1}^n e^{-t_i /\sqrt{\lambda}} \left| 1 - \Phi^d \right| \hat{H}(t) \right) \right] \\
  B &= \frac{1}{\left( \sum_{i=1}^n e^{2t_i /\sqrt{\lambda}} \right)\left( \sum_{i=1}^n e^{-2t_i /\sqrt{\lambda}} \right) - n^2} \left[ \left( \sum_{i=1}^n e^{2t_i /\sqrt{\lambda}} \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n e^{-t_i /\sqrt{\lambda}} \left| 1 - \Phi^d \right| \hat{H}(t_i) \right) - n \left( \sum_{i=1}^n e^{t_i /\sqrt{\lambda}} \left| 1 - \Phi^d \right| \hat{H}(t) \right) \right]
\end{align*}
$$

In the limit $\lambda \to 0$, there exists $\xi \in [0, 1]$ such that

$$
  \min_{(A, B) \in \R^2} \int_0^1 \left[ \Phi H(t) + Ae^{t/\sqrt{\lambda}} + Be^{-t/\sqrt{\lambda}} - H(t) \right]^2 \d t \leq 4\lambda^2 H''(\xi)^2 + O(\lambda^2)
$$
