# $\Z_2$-graded vector spaces

We denote by $\Z_2 := (+, \set{0,1})$ the Abelian group with underlying set $\set{0,1}$ equipped with the standard modulo $2$ addition given in Table $\ref{table-1}$.

<TableFigure caption="The abelian group $\Z_2$" tag="1">

Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $\mathbb{F}$. A $\Z_2$-grading on $V$ is a decomposition $V = V_0 \oplus V_1$ as an internal direct sum of subspaces $V_0$ and $V_1$. A vector space equipped such a decomposition is called a $\Z_2$-graded (or super) vector space.

Every vector $v\in V$ admits a unique decomposition $v = v_0 + v_1$, where $v_0 \in V_0$ and $v_1 \in V_1$. The vectors $v_0$ and $v_1$ are called homogenous components of $v$. A vector $v\in V$ lying in $V_0 \cup V_1$ is said to be homogenous, of definite parity (or degree). Elements of $V_0$ are called even, and have parity $0$, while elements of $V_1$ are odd, with parity $1$. The zero vector $0 \in V$ is the unique element of $V_0 \cap V_1$ and is therefore both odd and even. 

For a non-zero homogeneous vector $v\in V$, its parity is denoted by $\sigma(v) \in\Z_2$. This function is not intrinsically defined on $0$; in practice, we set $\sigma(0) = 0$ or $\sigma(0) = 1$ as convenient.

Let $U\subset V$ be a subspace. We say that $U$ is a $\Z_2$-graded subspace of $V$ if

$$
  U = (U \cap V_0) \oplus (V \cap V_1)
$$

equivalently, if the homogeneous components of every $u\in U$ lie in $U$. 

Let $V = V_0 \oplus V_1$ and $W = W_0 \oplus W_1$ be $\Z_2$-graded vector spaces. A linear map $g: V\to W$ is homogeneous of degree $\sigma(g) = \alpha\in\Z_2$ if $g(V_\beta) \subseteq W_{\beta + \alpha}$ for all $\beta\in\Z_2$. A homogeneous linear map of degree $0$ is called a $\Z_2$-graded homomorphism. A bijective graded homomorphism is called a $\Z_2$-graded isomorphism.

If $V = V_0 \oplus V_1$ and $V' = V'_0 \oplus V'_1$ are $\Z_2$-graded vector spaces over $\mathbb{F}$, then their tensor product $V \otimes V'$ has a canonical $\Z_2$-grading

$$
  V\otimes V' = (V\otimes V')_0 + (V\otimes V')_1
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
  (V\otimes V')_0 =& V_0 \otimes V'_0 + V_1 \otimes V'_1 \\
  (V\otimes V')_1 =& V_0 \otimes V'_1 + V_0 \otimes V'_1
\end{align*}
$$

Let $W = W_0 \oplus W_1$ and $W' = W'_0 \oplus W'_1$ be additional $\Z_2$-graded vector spaces, and let $g: V\to W$ and $g' : V' \to W'$ be homogeneous linear maps of degrees $\sigma(g)$ and $\sigma(g')$, respectively. We a linear map

$$
  g\otimes g' : V\otimes  V' \to W\otimes W'
$$

on homogeneous simple tensors by

$$
  (g\otimes g')(v\otimes v') = (-1)^{\sigma(v) \sigma(g')} g(v) \otimes g(v')
$$

and extend it linearly to all of $V\otimes V'$. With this convention, $g\otimes g'$ is a homogeneous linear map of degree

$$
  \sigma(g\otimes g') = \sigma(g) + \sigma(g')\in\Z_2
$$

This construction extends in a natural way to tensor products of finitely many $\Z_2$-graded vector spaces.

# $\Z_2$-graded algebras

Let $A$ be an algebra over a field $\mathbb{F}$. We say that $A$ is a $\Z_2$-graded algebra (or superalgebra) if
1. the underlying vector space of $A$ admits a $\Z_2$-grading $A_0 + A_1$ of $A$, where $A_0$ and $A_1$ are the even and odd subspaces of $A$, respectively, and
2. multiplication on $A$ is compatible with this grading in the sense that for all $\alpha, \beta \in\Z_2$
$$
\begin{equation*}
  A_\alpha A_\beta \subset A_{\alpha+\beta}
\tag{\label{equation-1}}
\end{equation*}
$$

where addition is taken modulo $2$. 

Equivalently, the product of two homogeneous elements of degree $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is homogeneous of degree $\alpha + \beta$.

<MathBox title="" boxType="proposition">
If a $\Z_2$-graded algebra $A$ has a unit element $1$, then it is even.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

We have for all $a\in A$ that $1a = a1 = a$. Suppose $1$ has homogeneous decomposition $1 = 1_0 + 1_1$. Then for all $a_0 \in A_0$ we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  1a_0 =& (1_0 + 1_1)a_0 = 1_0 a_0 + 1_1 a_0 = a_0 \\
  a_0 1 = a_0 (1_0 + 1_1) = a_0 1_0 + a_0 1_1 = a_0
\end{align*}
$$

Since $a_0$ is even, by condition $\eqref{equation-1}$ we must have $1_1 a_0 = a_0 1_1 = 0$ for all even $a_0 \in A_0$. Similarly, for all $a_1 \in A_1$ we have

$$
\begin{align*}
  1 a_1 =& (1_0 + 1_1) a_1 = 1_0 a_1 + 1_1 a_1 = a_1 \\
  a_1 1 =& a_1 (1_0 + 1_1) = a_1 1_0 + a_1 1_1 = a_1
\end{align*}
$$

Since $a_1$ is odd, by condition $\eqref{equation-1}$ we must have $a_1 1_1 = 1_1 a_1 = 0$ for all odd $a_1 \in A_1$. We know that an arbitrary element of $A$ can be decomposed uniquely as $a = a_0 + a_1$ with $a_0$ even and $a_1$ odd. Thus, we have for all $a\in A$

$$
\begin{align*}
  a =& 1a = 1(a_0 + a_1) = 1_0 a_0 + 1_0 a_1 = 1_0 (a_0 + a_1) = 1_0 a \\
  a =& a1 = (a_0 + a_1)1 = a_0 1_0 + a_1 1_0 = (a_0 + a_1)1_0 = a1_0
\end{align*}
$$

so that $1 = 1_0\in A_0$.

Let $A = A_0 \oplus A_1$ and $B = B_0 \oplus B_1$ be $\Z_2$-graded algebras over a field $\mathbb{F}$. A homomorphism of $\Z_2$-graded algebras is a linear map $\theta: A\to B$ such that
1. $\theta$ is a homomorphism of the underlying algebras, i.e. for all $a, a' \in A$
$$
\begin{align*}
  \theta(aa') =& \theta(a) \theta(a') \\
  \theta(a + a') =& \theta(a) + \theta(a')
\end{align*}
$$
2. $\theta$ is homogeneous of degree $0$, equivalently grade-preserving, i.e.
$$
  \theta(A_\alpha) \subseteq B_\alpha,\; \forall \alpha\in\Z_2
$$

In particular, if $a\in A$ is homogeneous, then $\sigma(\theta(a)) = \sigma(a)$.

An isomorphism of $\Z_2$-graded algebra is a bijective homomorphism of $\Z_2$-graded algebra. Equivalently, it is an algebra homomorphism that preserves the grading.

A $\Z_2$-graded subalgebra of a $\Z_2$-graded algebra $A$ is a subalgebra $B \subseteq A$ such that

$$
  B = (B \cap A_0) \oplus (B \cap A_1)
$$

that is, the underlying vector space of $B$ is a $\Z_2$-graded subspace of the underlying graded vector space of $A$.

A $\Z_2$-graded ideal of a $\Z_2$-graded algebra $A$ is an ideal $K \subseteq A$ such that

$$
  K = (K \cap A_0) \oplus (K \cap A_1)
$$

equivalently, $K$ is an ideal whose underlying vector space is a $\Z_2$-graded subspace of $A$.

<MathBox title="" boxType="proposition">
If $A$ is a $\Z_2$-graded algebra and $H$ is a two-sided $\Z_2$-graded ideal of $A$ then the quotient $A/H$ is a $Z_2$-graded algebra.

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

Consider an arbitrary element $aH \in A/H$. Since both $A$ and $H$ are $\Z_2$-graded, $a$ can be decomposed as $a_0 + a_1$ and $H$ decomposed as $H_0 + H_1$. Thus, the cosed $aH$ is decomoposed into even and odd parts as $(a_0 H_0 + a_1 H_1)$. Suppose that $bH = aH$ where $b\in A$. Then $b = ah$ for some $h \in H$. The domposition of $bH$ is

$$
  bH = (b_0 H_0 + b_1 H_1) + (b_1 H_0 + b_0 H_1)
$$

The element $h$ can be decomposed into itss homogeneous components so that we can write $h = h_0 + h_1$. We can now rewrite $bH$ as

$$
\begin{align*}
  bH =& [(a_0 h_0 + a_1 h_1)H_0 + (a_0 h_1 + a_1 h_0)H_1] \\
  &+ [(a_0 h_1 + a_1 h_0) H_0 + (a_0 h_0 + a_1 h_1)H_1]
\end{align*}
$$

Rearranging, this simplifies to

$$
\begin{align*}
  bH =& a_0 (h_0 + h_1)H_0 + a_1 (h_0 + h_1)H_1 \\
  &+ a_1 (h_0 + h_1) H_0 + a_0 (h_0 + h_1) H_1 \\
  =& (a_0 H_0 + a_1 H_1) + (a_1 H_0 + a_0 H_1)
\end{align*}
$$

so that the decomposition of the coset $cH$ into its homogeneous components is independent of $c$ and we have a consistent $A_2$-grading for $A/H$.

## Chevalley tensor product

Let $A$ and $B$ be associative $\Z_2$-graded algebras over a field $\mathbb{F}$, not necessarily unital. We define a multiplication on the $\Z_2$-graded tensor product $A\otimes B$ by linear extension of the following rule on homogeneous elements $a, a' \in A$ and homogeneous $b, b' \in B$

$$
\begin{equation*}
  (a \otimes b) (a' \otimes b') = (-1)^{\sigma(b)\sigma(a')} aa' \otimes bb'
\tag{\label{equation-2}}
\end{equation*}
$$

This multiplication is known as the Chevalley (or graded) tensor product. With this product, $A \otimes B$ becomes an associative $\Z_2$-graded algebra, whose grading is given by $\sigma(a\otimes b) = \sigma(a) + \sigma(b)$. If both $A$ and $B$ are unital then $A \otimes B$ is unital with unit element $1_A \otimes 1_{B}$. 

This multiplication differs from the ordinary tensor product of ungraded associative algebras by the presence of the Koszul sign factor, which encodes the interchange of homogeneous elements.

The Chevalley tensor product extends naturally to $n$-fold tensor products of associative $\Z_2$-graded algebras. Let $A_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes A_n$ be associative $\Z_2$-graded algebras. For homogeneous elements $a_i, a'_i \in A_i$ with $i = 1,\dots, n$ define and extend linearly

$$
  (a_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes a_n)(a'_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes a'_n) = (-1)^{\sum_{i > j} \sigma(a_i) \sigma(a'_j)} a_1 a'_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes a_n a'_n
$$

Equipped with this multiplication, $A_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes A_n$ is an associative $\Z_2$-graded algebra. If each $A_i$ is unital, then the Chevalley tensor product is unital with unit $1_{A_1} \otimes\cdots\otimes 1_{A_n}$. Associativity of the multiplication is compatible with the canonical graded isomorphisms

$$
  A_1 \otimes (A_2 \otimes A_3) \cong (A_1 \otimes A_2) \otimes A_3
$$

and more generally with all rebracketings of the tensor product in the form $(\cdots ((A_1 \otimes A_2)\otimes A_3) \otimes\cdots A_{n-1}) \otimes A_n$, making the category of $\Z_2$-graded algebras into a monoidal category.

## Graded modules

Let $A = A_0 \oplus A_1$ be an associative $\Z_2$-graded algebra, and let $M$ be a left module over the underlying algebra of $A$. We say that $M$ is a $\Z_2$-graded left $A$-module if the underlying vector space of $M$ admits a grading $M = M_0 \otimes M_1$ such that for all $\alpha, \beta\in\Z_2$

$$
  A_\alpha \cdot M_\beta \subset M_{\alpha + \beta}
$$

where $\cdot$ denotes the action of $A$ on $M$. The definition of a $\Z_2$-graded right $A$-module is analogous.

## Involutions

An involution on a $\Z_2$-algebra $A$ is a conjugate-linear map $\dagger: A\to A$ with the follwing properties
1. **Involutive:** $(a^\dagger)^\dagger = a$ for all $a\in A$
2. **Antimultiplicity:** $(ab)^\dagger = b^\dagger a^\dagger$ for all $a, b \in A$
3. **Grade-preserving:** $\dagger$ is homogeneous of degree $0$, i.e. $\sigma(a^\dagger) = \sigma(a)$ for all homogeneous $a\in A$.

The grade-preserving property is force by antimultiplicity: if $\dagger$ were odd, then for odd homogeneous elements $a, b$ the parity of $(ab)^\dagger$ (odd) would differ from that of $b^\dagger a^\dagger$ (even).

Let $A$ and $B$ be $\Z_2$-graded algebras equipped with involutions, both denoted $\dagger$. A $\dagger$-morphism (or *-morphism) from $A$ to $B$ is a graded algebra homomorphism $g: A\to B$ such that $g(a^\dagger) = g(a)^\dagger$ for all $a\in A$. An involution extends naturally to $n$-fold Chevalley tensor products of $\Z_2$-graded associative algebras by defining it on homogeneous simple tensors and extending conjugate-linearly.

# Lie superalgebra

<MathBox title="Lie superalgebra" boxType="definition" tag="1">
A Lie superalgebra is a nonassociative $\Z_2$-graded algebra $L = L_0 \oplus L_1$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$, whose multiplication $\{\cdot, \cdot\}: L\times L \to L$, called the Lie superbracket, satisfies the following relations for arbitrary homogeneous elements $a, b, c\in L$
1. **Graded skew-symmetry:** $\{a, b\} = -(-1)^{\sigma(a) \sigma(b)} \{b, a\}$. In particular, if $a$ is even, then $\{a, a\} = 0$, while for odd $a$ no such constraint is imposed.
2. **Graded Jacobi identity:**
$$
\begin{align*}
  0 =& (-1)^{\sigma(a) \sigma(c)} \{a, \{b, c\}\} \\
  &+ (-1)^{\sigma(b) \sigma(a)} \{b, \{c, a\}\} \\
  &+ (-1)^{\sigma(c) \sigma(b)} \{c, \{a, b\}\}
\end{align*}
$$

The Lie superbracket is of degree $0$ such that $\{L_\alpha, L_\beta \} \subseteq L_{\alpha + \beta}$ for all $\alpha, \beta \in\Z_2$.
</MathBox>

Lie superalgebras are not, in general, Lie algebras: the bracket is graded skew-symmetric rather than strictly skew-symmetric, and odd elements need not anticommute with themselves.

All homomorphisms of Lie superalgebras are, by definition, homogeneous linear maps of degree $0$ that preserve the Lie superbracket.

If $\dagger$ is an involution on a Lie superalgebra $L$ then for arbitrary $a, b \in L$ we have $\{a, b\}^\dagger = \{ b^\dagger , a^\dagger \}$. A Lie superalgebra equipped with such an involution is called a Lie $\dagger$-superalgebra.

## Lie superalgebra associated to an associative superalgebra

Let $A = A_0 \oplus A_1$ be an associative $\Z_2$-graded algebra. Denote by $A_\text{SLie}$ the underlying $\Z_2$-graded vector space of $A$, equipped with the multiplication $\{\cdot, \cdot\}_{A_\text{SLie}} : A\times A \to A$ defined by linear extension of the following rule for homogeneous elements $a, b \in A$

$$
  \{a, b\}_{A_\text{SLie}} = ab - (-1)^{\sigma(a) \sigma(b)} ba
$$

This operation is called the graded commutator. We show that $A_\text{SLie}$, equipped with this bracket, is a Lie superalgebra by verifying the bracket axioms in Definition $\ref{definition-1}$.

**Degree**

For homogeneous $a, b\in A$

$$
  \sigma(\{a, b\}_{A_\text{SLie}}) = \sigma(a) + \sigma(b)
$$

since the associative product in $A$ is of degree $0$. Hence the bracket is homogeneous of degree $0$.

**Graded skew-symmetry**

For homogeneous $a, b\in A$

$$
\begin{align*}
  & -(-1)^{\sigma(a)\sigma(b)} \{b, a\}_{A_\text{SLie}} \\
  =& -(1)^{\sigma(a)\sigma(b)} (ba - (-1)^{\sigma(b) \sigma(a)} ab) \\
  =& -(-1)^{\sigma(a)\sigma(b)} ba + ab \\
  =& ab - (-1)^{\sigma(a) \sigma(b)} ba \\
  =& \{a, b \}_{A_\text{SLie}}
\end{align*}
$$

**Graded Jacobi-identity**

For homogeneous $a, b, c \in A$, a straightforward calculation yields

$$
\begin{align*}
  & (-1)^{\sigma(a)\sigma(b)} \{a, \{b, c\}_{A_\text{SLie}} \}_{A_\text{SLie}} \\
  &+ (-1)^{\sigma(b)\sigma(a)} \{b, \{c, a\}_{A_\text{SLie}} \}_{A_\text{SLie}} \\
  &+ (-1)^{\sigma(c)\sigma(b)} \{c, \{a, b\}_{A_\text{SLie}} \}_{A_\text{SLie}} \\
  =& (-1)^{\sigma(a)\sigma(c)} \{a, (bc - (-1)^{\sigma(b) \sigma(c)} cb) \}_{A_\text{SLie}} \\
  &+ (-1)^{\sigma(b)\sigma(a)} \{b, (ca - (-1)^{\sigma(c) \sigma(a)} ac) \}_{A_\text{SLie}} \\
  &+ (-1)^{\sigma(c)\sigma(b)} \{c, (ab - (-1)^{\sigma(a) \sigma(b)} ba) \}_{A_\text{SLie}} \\
  =& (-1)^{\sigma(a)\sigma(c)} abc - (-1)^{\sigma(a)\sigma(c) + \sigma(a) [\sigma(b) + \sigma(c)]} bca \\
  &- (-1)^{\sigma(a)\sigma(c) + \sigma(b)\sigma(c)} acb + (-1)^{\sigma(a)\sigma(c) + \sigma(b)\sigma(c) + \sigma(a) [\sigma(c) + \sigma(b)]} cba \\
  &+ (-1)^{\sigma(b)\sigma(a)} bca - (-1)^{\sigma(b)\sigma(a) + \sigma(b)[\sigma(c) + \sigma(a)]} cab \\
  &- (-1)^{\sigma(b)\sigma(a) + \sigma(c)\sigma(a)} bac + (-1)^{\sigma(b)\sigma(a) + \sigma(c)\sigma(a) + \sigma(b) [\sigma(a) + \sigma(c)]} acb \\
  &+ (-1)^{\sigma(c)\sigma(b)} cab - (-1)^{\sigma(c)\sigma(b) + \sigma(c)[\sigma(a) + \sigma(b)]} abc \\
  &- (-1)^{\sigma(c)\sigma(b) + \sigma(a)\sigma(b)} cba + (-1)^{\sigma(c)\sigma(b) + \sigma(a)\sigma(b) + \sigma(c) [\sigma(b) + \sigma(a)]} bac \\
  =& 0
\end{align*}
$$

## Matrix Lie superalgebras

Let $\mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})$ denote the unital associative algebra of complex $n \times n$ matrices under standard matrix multiplication. Fix an integer $r\in\N_+$ with $1 \leq r < n$ and decompose $\mathbb{C}^n \cong \mathbb{C}^r \oplus \mathbb{C}^{n-r}$. This induces a block decomposition of matrices in $\mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})$. Define the even subspace 

$$
\mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})_0 := \Set{\begin{bmatrix}
  \mathbf{A}_1 & \mathbf{0}_r \\
  \mathbf{0}_{n - r} & \mathbf{A}_2
\end{bmatrix} : \mathbf{A}_1 \in \mathcal{M}_r (\mathbb{C}), \mathbf{A}_2 \in \mathcal{M}_{r - n} }
$$

and the odd subspace

$$
\mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})_1 := \Set{
\begin{bmatrix}
  \mathbf{0}_{n - r} & \mathbf{B}_1 \\
  \mathbf{B}_2 & \mathbf{0}_r
\end{bmatrix} : \mathbf{B}_1 \in \mathcal{M}_{r, n-r} (\mathbb{C}), \mathbf{B}_2 \in \mathcal{M}_{n-r, r}}
$$

Then

$$
  \mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C}) = \mathcal{M}_{n} (\mathbb{C})_0 \oplus \mathcal{M}_{n} (\mathbb{C})_1
$$

as a direct sum of vector subspaces, and a straightforward block-matrix computation shows that for all $\alpha, \beta\in\Z_2$ 

$$
  \mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})_\alpha \mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})_\beta \subset \mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})_{\alpha + \beta}
$$

Thus, $\mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})$ is a unital associative superalgebra.

Let $\mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})_\text{SLie}$ denote the underlying $\Z_2$-graded vector space of $\mathbb{M}_n (\mathbb{C})$, equipped with the graded commutator $\{\cdot, \cdot\}_{\mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})_\text{SLie}}$ defined on homogeneous $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B} \in \mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})_\text{SLie}$ by

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \{\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}\}_{\mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})_\text{SLie}} = \mathbf{AB} - (-1)^{\sigma(\mathbf{A}) \sigma(\mathbf{B})} \mathbf{BA}
\tag{\label{equation-3}}
\end{equation*}
$$

and extended linearly. By the general construction of Lie superalgebras from associative superalgebras, $\mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})_\text{SLie}$ is a Lie superalgebra.

Define an involution $\dagger: \mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C}) \to \mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})$ by $\mathbf{A}^\dagger = \overline{\mathbf{A}}^\top$, i.e. the conjugate transpose of $\mathbf{A}$. Since $\overline{\mathbf{AB}}^\top = \overline{\mathbf{B}}^\top \overline{\mathbf{A}}^\top$, it follows from $\eqref{equation-3}$ that $\{\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}\}^\dagger = \{\mathbf{B}^\dagger, \mathbf{A}^\dagger \}$ for all $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B} \in\mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})$. Thus, $\mathcal{M}_n (\mathbb{C})_\text{SLie}$ is a Lie $\dagger$-superalgebra.

## Endomorphism Lie superalgebras

Let $V = V_0 \oplus V_1$ be a $\Z_2$-graded vector space over a field $\mathbb{F}$, and let $\operatorname{end}(V)$ denote the unital associative algebra of linear endomorphisms in $V$. Define a $\Z_2$-grading on $\operatorname{end}(V)$ by

$$
\begin{align*}
  \operatorname{end}(V)_0 :=& \set{A \in\operatorname{end}(V) | A(V_\alpha) \subset V_\alpha,\; \forall \alpha\in\Z_2} \\
  \operatorname{end}(V)_1 :=& \set{A \in\operatorname{end}(V) | A(V_\alpha) \subset V_{\alpha + 1},\; \forall \alpha\in\Z_2} \\
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, $\operatorname{end}(V)_0$ consists of degree-$0$ (grade-preserving) endomorphisms and $\operatorname{end}(V)_1$ consists of homogeneous endomorphisms of degree $1$. It follows that $\operatorname{end}(V) = \operatorname{end}(V)_0 \oplus \operatorname{end}(V)_1$ and that, for all $\alpha,\beta\in\Z_2$, we have $\operatorname{end}(V)_\alpha \operatorname{end}(V)_\beta \subset \operatorname{end}(V)_{\alpha + \beta}$. Thus, $\operatorname{end}(V)$ is a unital associative superalgebra. Applying the graded commutator construction yields the endomorphism Lie superalgebra $\operatorname{end}(V)_\text{SLie}$.

<MathBox title="Graded representation of Lie superalgebra" boxType="definition" tag="2">
A graded representation of a Lie superalgebra $L$ in a $\Z_2$-graded vector space $V$ is a homomorphism of $L$ into $\operatorname{end}(V)_\text{SLie}$.

# The universal enveloping superalgebra

<MathBox title="Universal enveloping superalgebra of Lie superalgebra" boxType="definition" tag="3">
Let $L = L_0 \otimes L_1$ be a Lie superalgebra over a field $\mathbb{F}$. A universal enveloping superalgebra of $L$ is a pair $(U, \iota)$, where 
- $U$ is a unital associative $\Z_2$-graded algebra and 
- $\iota: L\to U_\text{SLie}$ is a homomorphism of Lie superalgebras
such that the following universal property holds: For every unital associative $\Z_2$-graded algebra $A$ and every homomorphism of Lie superalgebras $\phi: L\to A_\text{SLie}$, there exists a homomorphism of unital $\Z_2$-graded algebras $\tilde{\phi}: U\to A$ satisfying $\phi = \tilde{\phi}\circ\iota$. In this case the diagram in Figure $\ref{figure-1}$ commutes.

<TikzFigure caption='Universal property of enveloping superalgebra' tag="1">
{String.raw`\begin{tikzcd}[

</TikzFigure>
</MathBox>

Let $(U, \iota)$ be a universal enveloping superalgebra of a Lie superalgebra $L$ and let $\phi: L\to A_\text{SLie}$ be a Lie superalgebra homomorphism. We say that the homomorphism $\tilde{\phi}$ extends $\phi$. If $(U', \iota')$ is a second pair satisfying the universal property in Definition $\ref{definition-3}$, then there exist a unique isomorphism of unital associative algebras $\theta: U \xrightarrow{\sim} U'$ such that $\iota' = \theta\circ\iota$. In particular, the universal enveloping superalgebra of $L$ is unique up to isomorphism.

In practice, we identity $L$ with its image in $U$ via the canonical isomorphism $\iota$, regarding each $a\in L$ as an element of $U$. The algebra $U$ is unital with unit $1_U$. If $\tilde{\phi}: U\to A$ extends a Lie superalgebra homorphism $\phi: L\to A_\text{SLie}$, where $A$ is a unital associative $\Z_2$-graded algebra with unit $1_A$, then $\tilde{\phi}(1_U) = 1_A$. This follows from the fact that $\tilde{\phi}$ is a homomorphism of unital associative algebras.

If $L$, $U$ and $A$ are equipped with involutions and $\phi$ is a $\dagger$-morphism of Lie superalgebras, then its extension $\tilde{\phi}$ is automatically a $\dagger$-morphism of associative $\Z_2$-graded algebras, i.e. $\tilde{\phi}(x^\dagger) = \tilde{\phi}(x)^\dagger$ for all $x\in U$.

Also assume that whenever the pair of basis elements $L_{i_p}$ and $L_{i_{p+1}}$ are both odd, then $i_p < i_{p+1}$. For each $\alpha = (i_1,\dots,i_s)\tilde{I}$ define an element $L_\alpha \in U$ by $L_\alpha = L_{i_1} \cdots L_{i_s}$. Then the family $\set{L_\alpha}_{\alpha\in\tilde{I}}$ forms a basis of $U(L)$ as a vector space over $\mathbb{F}$.

Let $I$ be an index set and let $\tilde{I}$ denote the set of finite sequences $\alpha = (i_1,\dots,i_s)$. For $\alpha \in\tilde{I}$, we define the length of $\alpha$ by $|\alpha| := s$. For each $\alpha\in\tilde{I}$, the corresponding PBW basis element $L_\alpha = L_{i_i} \cdots L_{i_s} \in U(L)$ has degree $\operatorname{deg}(L_\alpha) := |\alpha|$. Every element $u\in U(L)$ can be written uniquely as a finite linear combination

$$
  u = \sum_{\alpha\in\tilde{I}} c_\alpha L_\alpha,\; c_\alpha \in\mathbb{F}
$$

with only finitely many nonzero coefficients. Since this sum is finite, there exists a maximal integer $d = \max\set{|\alpha| : c_\alpha \neq 0}$. The degree of $u$ is defined as $\operatorname{deg}(u) := d$.

This degree function defines an increasing filtration $\set{F_d U(L)}_{d \geq 0}$ on the universal enveloping algebra, where

$$
  F_d U(L) := \operatorname{span}\set{L_\alpha : |\alpha| \geq d}
$$

This filtration is compatible with the associative multiplication on $U(L)$.

Let $U$ be the universal enveloping superalgebra of a Lie superalgebra $L$. Suppose that $K$ is the ideal of $U$ generated by $L$ such that $K = ULU$. Then 

$$
  U = \operatorname{Cl}_U \oplus K
